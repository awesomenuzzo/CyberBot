ABSTRACT Although blockchain-based digital services promise trust, accountability, and transparency,
multiple paradoxes between blockchains and GDPR have been highlighted in the recent literature. Some
of the recent literature also proposed possible solutions to these paradoxes. This article aims to conduct
a systematic literature review on GDPR compliant blockchains and synthesize the findings. In particular,
the goal was to identify 1) the GDPR articles that have been explored in prior literature; 2) the relevant
research domains that have been explored, and 3) the research gaps. Our findings synthesized that the
blockchains relevant GDPR articles can be categorized into six major groups, namely data deletion and
modification (Article 16, 17, and 18), protection by design by default (Article 25), responsibilities of
controllers and processors (Article 24, 26, and 28), consent management (Article 7), data processing
principles and lawfulness (Article 5,6 and 12), and territorial scope (Article 3). We also found seven
research domains where GDPR compliant blockchains have been discussed, which include IoT, financial
data, healthcare, personal identity, online data, information governance, and smart city. From our analysis,
we have identified a few key research gaps and present a future research direction.
INDEX TERMS Blockchain, general data protection regulation (GDPR), systematic literature review.

I. INTRODUCTION

Blockchain is based on a distributed and synchronized digital database for recording information. The database is
maintained by a consensus algorithm and stored in multiple nodes [1]. Blockchain and its associated technologies
(e.g., smart contracts) promise a new generation of smart
services that help establish transparency, accountability, and
trust [2].
In 2018, the European Unions’ (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which seeks to harmonize data protection laws across the EU states and aims to give back control
of data to its owner, came in place [3]. This raised multiple
paradoxes between blockchain and GDPR. The challenges
arise concerning the implementation of blockchain technology while complying with the GDPR recommendations.
For instance, two of the most evident challenges described
by the European Parliamentary Research Service (EPRS)
are [4], [5]:

.

i. As per recommendations of the GDPR, there should
be at least one data controller. Controller will manage
consent of data subject and shall be reachable by
the data subjects. However, blockchain is based on
decentralization, which would mean replacing a data
controller with many different players—this makes
the allocation of responsibility and accountability
burdensome [6].
ii. GDPR recommends data minimization, purpose limitation, modification, and deletion of data when
necessary. However, blockchain is an append-only
database that continuously grows as new data is
added. Modification and deletion are not recommended in the blockchain to ensure data integrity and
trust [7].
These challenges and tensions are multifaceted in nature.
There is no single solution that may fit in all business cases.
For example, EPRS pointed that ‘‘blockchain architects need
to be aware of this [challenge] from the outset and make
sure that they design their respective use cases in a manner that allows compliance with European data protection
law’’. However, prior research observed that blockchains

and data protection regulations are a less discussed topic
in the academic literature [8]. Indeed, a few technical solutions have been proposed in prior research for addressing
some of the GDPR article requirements [9]–[11]. While there
are a number of literature studies summarizing blockchain
research [71]–[73], its applications [17], [74], [75], and even
ethical dimensions [76], [77], however, till date, no systematic review exists to summarize the progress on the topic of
integrating GDPR and blockchain. As this remains a critical
legal and practical question for the adoption of blockchain
technology in the European Union, the purpose of this paper
is to conduct a systematic literature review on the topic and
answer the following research questions.
RQ1: Which GDPR articles (compliance issues) have been
explored for blockchain integration?
RQ2: What research areas have been explored about
blockchain and GDPR compliance?
RQ3: What are the research gaps in the GDPR compliant
blockchain domain?
We conducted this SLR by following the methodology
set by Kitchenham and Charters [12]. After running the
analysis and applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria,
we considered 39 research articles in this SLR. We conducted
an in-depth study of these research articles and thematically categorized the GDPR articles that are critical to the
blockchain. After that, we summarized possible solutions
to tackle the GDPR issues. Moreover, we also thematically
categorized the literature based on the application areas. This
led us to identify research gaps that can be filled in future
research.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. After this
introductory section, we introduce blockchain technology
and GDPR briefly in section 2. Then in section 3, we present
the SLR methodology. In section 4, we summarize the findings from the SLR, answer the RQs and provide discussions
on the findings. In section 5, we describe the contribution of
this paper. Finally, section 6 concludes the paper.
II. BACKGROUND
A. BLOCKCHAIN

Blockchain technology has unique characteristics that make it
very favorable for many applications [13]. The main features
of blockchain are decentralization, consensus mechanism,
provenance, immutability, and finality. Decentralization
means there is no single most powerful entity that controls
the blockchain [14]. The whole system runs on the common agreement of its participants. This common agreement
is called consensus [15]. When all the blockchain network
participants agree on a transaction, only then the transaction is
executed. The consensus mechanism makes the system very
trustworthy. Provenance characteristic ensures the traceability of data blocks. In a blockchain network, each block is
traceable. If an asset is sold on a blockchain system, it must
have detailed construction time of the previous owner’s detail
saved in its blocks. When a piece of valid information is
recorded in a specific block, no one in the network can change
50594

or alter it. This immutable nature of blockchain makes it more
secure than other methods [16]. Blockchain technology has
its application in various sectors, for example, financial, IoT,
healthcare, smart city, etc. Blockchain provides transparency
and trust among the stakeholders [17], [18].
There are two major types of blockchain: public and private. A public blockchain is spread over a large geographical location. The data is visible to everyone. Although a
public blockchain can keep data confidentiality and integrity,
it lacks data privacy [19]. Private and consortium blockchain,
on the contrary, spread over a specific region fixed by the
enterprises. Thus, the data inside this type of blockchain is
comparatively restricted [20].
B. GDPR

GDPR is designed for the EU citizens to control their data
and information. GDPR was launched as a replacement of the
EU’s archaic data protection directive in 1995, later reserved
for the UK’s information and data protection law in 1998.
This was later replaced by the general data protection regulations [21]. The sole aim of GDPR is to make it easier
and cheaper for companies to comply with data protection
regulations [22]. With the rapid growth of digital technologies
and an increasing digitalization rate in all sectors like business, healthcare, education, the governments, and citizens are
concerned about privacy issues.
Consequently, on May 25, 2018, the new general data
protection regulation was launched. It creates a significant
impact on all sectors of industries. GDPR focuses on personal
data in general. This regulation helps the user to understand
how their data is being used. Similarly, the regulations guide
the companies on how to manage and process personal data.
Any sort of data that can identify the data subject is termed
as personal data. It can be the name, phone number, location
data, email address, GPS data tied to any identifiable information, or even the IP address [23].
A digital service needs to be compliant with GDPR recommendations, and the service provider should have responsibilities as a controller, collector, and processor [24]. The
responsibility of the data collector is to move the data from
one service provider to another quickly. The data processor
must seek permission from the controller to change, add, and
delete individuals’ stored personal data and information. The
data controller has the authority to share data with third-party
organizations or countries. To do that, the controller needs
to have a holistic idea about the third party’s total data management and processing lifecycle. A GDPR compliant digital service must have data minimization, fairness, accuracy,
transparency, and confidentiality [25].
Having discussed the characteristics of blockchains and
recommendations of the GDPR, there is a need to harmonize
between the two to establish common grounds for developing
GDPR compliant blockchains. As a step towards developing
GDPR compliant blockchains and understanding state of the
art, this SLR was conducted. The focus of the SLR was to
investigate the questions identified earlier while considering

the fundamentals of the blockchains and principles laid by
GDPR.
III. METHODOLOGY

In this paper, we followed the Systematic Literature Review
(SLR) approach to collect primary studies. An SLR is defined
as a specific type of review that addresses a focused research
theme and detailed representation. In contrast to an unstructured review, an SLR is done by following a predefined
procedure, and it is – to some extent – reproducible by
other scholars [12]. This study identified the research articles according to the methodology set by Kitchenham and
Charters [12]. We selected appropriate keywords for performing the search. After the search results have been found,
we applied various parameters and criteria to filter out less
relevant articles. After that, we prepared a final list of articles and analyzed them to address the research questions
adequately.
A. LITERATURE SELECTION

One of the most effective methods of selecting literature
is setting the required search protocol. Keywords are core
components of the search strategy. The keywords are generally produced from the research questions. Moreover, some
of the substitutes of the technical words are used. We used
Boolean operator ‘‘AND’’. The keywords used include,
‘‘Blockchain’’, ‘‘GDPR’’, ‘‘Distributed Ledger Technology’’,
‘‘Data Protection Act’’. The resultant search strings used for
this study are as below.
• (‘‘Blockchain’’ AND ‘‘GDPR’’)
• (‘‘Distributed Ledger technology’’ AND ‘‘GDPR’’)
• (‘‘Blockchain’’ AND ‘‘Data Protection Act’’)
Searches were performed in the title, keywords, and
abstracts. The search result was extracted on Nov. 28, 2020.
The searched databases include Scopus and IEEE. Scopus is a
well-established database that indexes high-quality research
articles. This database is widely recognized and researchers
across the world use it as a standard. Moreover, we performed
the search on IEEE Xplore Digital library for enlarging the
search scope. After the results were extracted, they were
filtered through inclusion and exclusion parameters, which
are explained in the next section.
B. EXCLUSION AND INCLUSION CRITERIA

The articles were selected based on an outline set by [12].
The following exclusion and inclusion criteria were applied
to extract the final list of articles.
Exclusion criteria:
i. Review articles, book chapters, and theses.
ii. Duplicate articles.
iii. Articles that do not discuss compliance issues rather
discuss blockchain and GDPR in general.
Inclusion Criteria:
i. The study is published in English language.
ii. Full text is available in the digital databases.
VOLUME 9, 2021

iii. The article must be published in a journal or magazine
or conference proceeding.
iv. The article reports a case study or proposes a method
or a framework on GDPR compliance issues of
blockchain.
C. RESULTS OF THE QUERIES

Initially, 156 articles were found in the Scopus database with
the search terms. In addition, 67 articles were found in the
IEEE database search. We merged the two databases that
resulted in 223 articles. Among them, 46 were duplicates.
Therefore, 177 articles remained after removing the duplicates. Among them, 76 articles were found irrelevant and out
of scope for this study after reading the titles, and abstracts.
After thoroughly reading the full text of the rest of the articles
and applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 39 articles
were considered for this SLR. The article names and sources
can be found in in reference section (ref no. [28] – ref no. [66])
Table 1 shows the initial data extraction based on various
keywords.

Figure 1 presents the details of article screening and selection process.
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
A. RESEARCH TREND

Blockchain was first presented in 2008 with the published
paper on bitcoin [13]. GDPR, on the other hand, did not start
earlier than May 25, 2018, although the discussion about the
proposal and legislation started earlier [26], [27].
Research articles published throughout the years are an
effective way to observe the research trend and impact (see
Figure 2). From the literature search, we observe that articles
regarding blockchain and GDPR first began in 2017. Therefore, it is a relatively new research area, and the number of
papers keeps increasing with time. Various types of articles
have been published over the years. We observed that in
total there are 24 conference articles, 13 journal articles,

and 2 magazine articles. Table 2 represents the number of
articles and publication years. We observed that there are
24 conference articles, 13 journal articles, and 2 magazine
articles considered in this study.
The number of articles published by various publishers is
shown in Table 3. We observed that IEEE, ACM, Elsevier,
50596

and Springer are the main publishers in GDPR compliant
blockchain research.
The authors who published the research papers included
in this SLR are affiliated with various countries (see Table 4).
We observed that most of the affiliations were from the United
Kingdom (UK) and EU regions. This is no surprise since
GDPR is designed and implemented in the EU regions. However, we also observed some studies from the Asian countries
such as China, South Korea, Malaysia, and Taiwan. Though
smaller in number, studies have been conducted in North and
South American regions as well.
B. ADDRESSING RQ1

The first research question considered for this study was
‘Which GDPR articles (compliance issues) have been

consensus mechanism that would delete a block from the
chain [36]. A blockchain consensus algorithm is used to add
new blocks to the chain after verification. Similar to this, the
authors suggested whether a consensus can be designed to
delete a block from a blockchain so that each node or the
controlling authority can be aware of it and provide consent to
it. Finally, smart contract-based solutions are also approached
as possible solutions [37], [38]. Smart contracts can execute
tasks under certain conditions. In this case, upon user consent,
smart contracts can do the task of deleting or modifying
the data [35], [39], [40]. Since smart contracts work under
specific conditions, user confirmation can be used as that
condition.
2) RESPONSIBILITIES OF CONTROLLERS AND PROCESSORS
(ARTICLE 24, 26, AND 28)

Article 4 states the definition of personal data, controller,
processor, pseudonymization, etc. In turn, articles 24 and
28 describe data controllers’ and processors’ roles and
responsibilities. Blockchain has a specific problem with identifying these roles since there is no centralized authority to
control all the nodes [30], [31], [41]. Several approaches
have been proposed in prior literature, such as defining the
participating nodes as controllers [42], [43], data providers as
controllers and miners as processors [44], actors who are able
to execute a transaction and add a block as the controllers,
joint controllers for federated blockchain [45], and developers
as processors for smart contracts [46]–[49].
explored for Blockchain integration?’ The GDPR articles that
have been focused on in prior studies and their proposed
compliance approaches are outlined as follows, however,
these have been identified in Figure 3 and briefly presented
in Table 5.
1) DATA DELETION AND MODIFICATION
(ARTICLE 16, 17 & 18)

One of the most important and common contradictions found
in prior literature is about Article 17 of GDPR that states
about ‘‘right to be forgotten’’. That means the concerned
organizations should delete the user data if the user requests
for it. Since information inside the blockchain cannot be
removed, it directly contradicts with Article 17 [28]–[33].
Technically, the same goes for Article 16 (right to rectification) also since data cannot be edited either [29], [34].
There are three methods proposed to approach this issue.
The first and perhaps the most used approach is storing the
data in off-chain. It means the original data is stored outside
the blockchain and its instance is stored inside the blockchain.
The two data are linked with hash and other identifiable
information. A specific key management protocol is used,
which can be named logical deletion [34], [35]. Logical
deletion is performed by destroying the link between the
off-chain and on-chain data or removing the private key.
The second approach to tackle the problem is to define a
VOLUME 9, 2021

3) PROTECTION AND PRIVACY BY DESIGN (ARTICLE 25)

Prior works highlighted that some of the compliance issues
related to privacy and protection by design exist by default
in blockchain [36]–[39]. Therefore, these studies viewed
that blockchain services are compliant with article 25 of
GDPR [30], [47]. Blockchain provides data immutability,
confidentiality, and integrity by default. Therefore, subjects’
data remains protected against any unauthorized access, data
alteration or change, and integrity compromise. Moreover,
blockchain uses cryptographic hash functions that make the
block data immutable.
4) CONSENT MANAGEMENT (ARTICLE 7)

Article 7 of GDPR emphasizes consent management conditions. The controller’s responsibility regarding the data processing upon the user’s permission is discussed [31]. The user
has the right to give permissions, withdraw consent for processing and storage [31], [51]. Users’ data cannot be stored
and processed without their consent [52]. As mentioned in the
previous section, there are no fixed controllers or processors
in the blockchain. For this reason, it is difficult to manage the
user’s consent to process their data. Saglam et al. [53] discussed that smart contracts can be an effective tool for consent
management. The authors highlighted that the compliance
codes for consents can be encoded into smart contracts and
stored in the blockchain. The contracts can later be used as
proof for personal data processing by controllers.

FIGURE 3. Proposed Solutions for GDPR Compliance.

5) DATA PROCESSING PRINCIPLES AND LAWFULNESS
(ARTICLE 5, 6 AND 12)

Articles 5 and 6 focus on data processing nature, especially
mentioning confidentiality, transparency, integrity, and truthfulness of the minimized personal data. Blockchain data
is distributed all over the network nodes. Each block uses
the hash value of the previous block. This process goes
on as long as the chain is not destroyed. So, technically
the block data is automatically processed as long as the
chain is active [45], [53]. On the other hand, GDPR recommends the reduction of automatic data processing [55], [56].
To tackle this, Zemler and Westner [29] and Freund et al. [54]
highlighted that personal data collected should be as minimal as possible, and processing should be within a limited
scope.
6) TERRITORIAL SCOPE (ARTICLE 3)

Article 3 is about controlling the user data from being processed and stored outside the geographical area of the EU.
In the case of the public blockchain, it is difficult since
the nodes exist worldwide. The situation is different in the
case of private and federated blockchain since the nodes are
spread over a fixed region [45], [48], [58]. Therefore, private
and federated blockchains are preferred to comply with the
territorial scope. Besides, the authors discussed the impact of
appropriate security measures while data processing and data
transfer from one region to another [55].

C. ADDRESSING RQ2

The second research question considered in the study was
‘What research areas have been explored about blockchain
and GDPR compliance?’ The research areas explored about
blockchain and GDPR are outlined in the next subsections.
We present a summary of the findings in Table 6, and different
solutions are presented graphically in Figure 4.
1) INTERNET OF THINGS (IOT)

IoT is the most widely explored research area. We observed
from our literature review that blockchain is often integrated
with IoT for ensuring security and data integrity. IoT is used
in various domains such as healthcare, industrial applications, and smart grid. IoT services need to collect and process versatile personal data to function [64]. Personal data
collected by IoT falls under the scope of GDPR. One of
the approaches is integrating data protection mechanisms in
IoT ecosystem design (Article 25) using blockchain [63].
This approach ensures the integrity, confidentiality, and transparency of data. Another approach proposed is the use of
smart contracts [62]. The smart contracts can be used for a
compliance audit, verification purposes, data subjects consent
management, and compliance history management.
2) HEALTHCARE

Healthcare data comprises a patient’s medical history [58].
Therefore, healthcare data is considered as a special category

FIGURE 4. Research domains and proposed solution approaches.

of data according to article 9 of GDPR. Prior literature discussed secure data exchange enabled, trustworthy, traceable,
and decentralized data management models [29], [57] for
healthcare data storage and transaction. Bayle et al. [42], Stan
and Miclea [58] and Zheng et al. [65] discussed the off-chain
storage architecture of healthcare data management. Instead
of storing the original data in the blockchain, only the proof
of existence is stored in on-chain. Bayle et al. [42] and Stan
and Miclea [58] also proposed the mechanism of consent
revoking. The link between, on-chain and off-chain can be
destroyed for the data deletion upon consent deletion.
In addition, Stan and Miclea [58] discussed the geographical location of data storage issues. Zemler and
Westner [29] analyzed the compliance issues for healthcare sectors and discussed the confidentiality, integrity, and
trustworthiness of the data that the blockchain system provides. Mohammadi et al. [66] proposed to include a separate privacy-enhancing layer with their proposed GDPR
compliant model. Wyciślik and Marcinkowska [33] highlighted medical documents tracing and auditing systems
using blockchain.

supposed to be confidential. It helps to build trust and transparency in business and transactions. Giannopoulou [43]
and Sim et al. [31] discussed the existing blockchain-based
identity management systems and their issues for GDPR
compliance. The authors have highlighted compliance issues
regarding data modification and deletion. Schmelz et al. [50]
presented GDPR compliance issues regarding protecting data subject’s rights and data security. Similarly,
Pedrosa et al. [56] discussed the data subject’s consent management and data minimization. Kondova and Erbguth [46]
and Damian et al. [37] proposed GDPR compliant identity management approaches. Damian et al. [37] proposed
a GDPR compliant approach that uses ArtChain and PrivateSky protocols and focuses on using on-chain and
off-chain architectures. Similarly, Al-Zaben et al. [38] and
Truong et al. [34] proposed on-chain and off-chain data storage for personal data management. Truong et al. [34] highlighted using smart contracts for compliance design along
with consent management. Jambert [44] emphasized identifying GDPR roles, responsibilities and ensuring privacy by
design for personal identity management.

3) PERSONAL IDENTITY

4) ONLINE DATA

An identity management system is needed in most digital services. Identity management systems deal with mostly
personal data. Since blockchain provides a tamper-proof
mechanism to store personal data, it is an effective and
suitable choice. Due to the immutable nature, the data is

Under this category, we have included social network data,
e-commerce data, cloud-based data, and other online data.
In most cases, consent management is weak in social network
websites, but these sites collect a lot of personal data. For
this reason, consent collection and management is prioritized.

50600

VOLUME 9, 2021

A. B. Haque et al.: GDPR Compliant Blockchains–Systematic Literature Review

The use of private blockchain is also recommended to have
better control and management [52]. Varghese et al. [28]
discussed edge marketplace. In case of compliance issues,
off-chain storage is recommended. Aujla et al. [55] recommended using smart contracts and blockchain for consent
management and data movement tracing in cloud-based data
compliance framework. Similar to what we previously mentioned, the use of blockchain technology causes compliance
issues regarding the difficulty in role identification, data modification, and deletion. Saglam et al. [53] proposed the use of
smart contract and off-chain data storage techniques. Smart
contracts can be used for consent management as mentioned
in previous sections as well [39], [67].
5) FINANCIAL DATA

This category of data includes bank data, insurance data,
and cryptocurrency-related compliance issues. In the case of
bank-related data, Ma et al. [35] focused on privacy-oriented
banking data management. The authors also discussed issues
and opportunities of adopting a decentralized environment.
Billard and Bartolomei [63] highlighted the consent collection and management system for customer’s personal data.
Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are public blockchains. Personal identity in most cryptocurrencies is pseudonymized.
Therefore, it falls under GDPR compliance issues. Identifying data collectors and processors are the compliance issues
related to bitcoin [41].
6) INFORMATION GOVERNANCE

This is crucial for modern urbanization and organization management. Dutta et al. [45] and Hofman et al. [48] discussed
information governance and its compliance problems with
GDPR. The authors discussed the roles and applicability
of GDR compliant blockchain in information governance.
Dutta et al. [45] proposed network administrators and miners
as controllers and processors, respectively. The authors have
also highlighted smart contract developers as the data controller and the contract itself as the data processor. In addition, for making the data anonymous, the authors discussed
zero-knowledge proof.
7) SMART CITY

The smart city is the epitome of rapid modern urbanization. Citizens’ personal data collection, storage, and
transfer happen throughout its network. Fabiano [64] and
Makhdoom et al. [61] discussed GDPR compliance issues
with blockchain in terms of difficulty in determining roles
of controller and processor, data deletion, and modification
difficulty, etc. The authors also opined that permissioned
blockchain makes it relatively easy for determining roles
whereas permission-less blockchain makes it challenging.
Makhdoom et al. [61] emphasized privacy by design and
consent management. Surveillance systems collect various
types of personal data for identifying persons and their
history. For this reason, this category of data is crucial
to be considered for compliance issues. Asghar et al. [59]
VOLUME 9, 2021

discussed surveillance data collection, types of data, compliance issues, and proposed solutions. The authors have proposed the use of off-chain to store personal data with a view
to solve the data deletion, modification-related compliance
issues. Only the proof of existence shall be stored inside the
blockchain [68]–[70].
D. ADDRESSING RQ3

The third and final research question considered was ‘What
are the research gaps in the GDPR compliant blockchain
domain?’ In the previous sections, we presented the GDPR
articles that have been considered, their probable solution
approach, and the focused research areas. We also observed
that GDPR compliant blockchain is a relatively new research
topic. After a careful analysis of the literature considered for
the study, the following are some major research gaps that can
be explored in the future.
i. First, our analysis shows various domains that have
been explored for blockchain and GDPR related compliance issues. Based on our observations we have not
found any article that discusses the issues in the industrial domain. Blockchain is a very widely used technology in the industrial sector. Therefore, compliance
issues in the industrial domain can be useful research
directions for GDPR and industrial data compliance.
ii. Second, we observed limited research on smart cities.
Smart homes and smart buildings are essential components of future smart cities. Both of these infrastructures deal with personal data and the use of
blockchain [67], [68]. For this reason, data privacy and protection regulation compliance are very
important. Extensive research and compliance mechanism framework should be very impactful and highly
recommended.
iii. Third, data minimization in blockchain, along with
automatic data processing is a major contradiction
with the GDPR recommendations [29], [54]–[56].
Blockchain uses the previous block’s hash and continues towards the next blocks. For this reason, the user
data entered once, is being processed every time a new
block is added. We found only a limited number of
research studies that discuss and propose solutions to
this problem. Therefore, future research in this direction would be useful.
iv. Fourth, expanding the research scope for private
blockchain. GDPR is perhaps suitable for centralized
architecture since this type of architecture is ideally
suitable for defining data controllers and processors
(Article 24 and 28 respectively). Private blockchain
shows a more centralized framework compared to the
public blockchain. It is already proposed that private
blockchain miners can act as processors [45]. Moreover, private blockchain can limit the territorial scope.
For this reason, further research in private blockchain
can be beneficial for mitigating the compliance issues
between blockchain and GDPR.

TABLE 6. (Continued.) The research domains discussed in prior literature.

v. Fifth, blockchain is used for various sectors related
to education [69], [70]. Educational institutions deal
with the personal data of students, teachers, and other
staff. From our SLR, we did not find a study that
addresses the data privacy regulations related to the
use of blockchain in educational institutions. Therefore, GDPR compliant blockchain in the domain of
education is one potential area of future research and
use case design.
vi. Finally, the privacy by design approach is discussed
in some of the literature included in this SLR. Privacy
by design is one of the most important additions of
GDPR. Therefore, it needs to be explored in more
detail. In addition to that, the inherent attributes of
blockchain that comply with these regulations can
be explored elaborately so that GDPR compliant
blockchain usage can be expanded.
V. CONTRIBUTIONS

In this work, we have outlined the compliance issues of
blockchain with GDPR. We have discussed the areas that
have been explored in prior literature. Furthermore, we have
identified a number of research gaps. Therefore, our work
has several implications for future research and practice. The
implications are as follows.
i. The first and most important contribution of this work
is to the best of our knowledge there is no previous
systematic review on blockchain and GDPR compliance issues. Our paper synthesizes the findings in
this research topic. This literature review work will
entice the researchers to find out the unexplored areas

compliant and non-compliant articles at one place
and their comprehensive summary. This will also be
valuable for practitioners. GDPR has an impact on
companies in European regions and also companies
that deal with EU citizen data around the world. The
summarized results (presented in Figure 3 and 4) can
help practitioners find possible solutions to a particular GDPR challenge in their business case.
ii. Second, this paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the GDPR articles that have been explored
for compliance issues. We have seen that the right
to be forgotten has been explored more and various
directions have been proposed [e.g., 28-34]. Similarly,
data processing and controlling role definitions have
also been explored vastly [40]–[49]. In addition to
that, privacy by design and their integration has been
discussed [e.g., 30, 31, 35]. The concise representation
of the articles explored facilitates the researchers to
explore the less explored GDPR articles. Some of
these less explored articles are related to data subject’s
consent management, data subjects’ right, territorial
scope, and defining joint controllers. Analyzing these
issues will help to scale up the research scopes in the
future.
iii. Third, we have analyzed and provided a very detailed
overview of the research areas that have been taken
into consideration until now. For example, healthcare,
identity management, and IoT are the most explored
domains for compliance issues [e.g., 48, 62-66]. Some
areas, for example, cryptocurrency, smart grid, smart
and wearable devices, industrial data are unexplored.
These areas involve and produce a large amount of
personal data. Our observation from this analysis will

help the potential researchers to gaze their sight onto
those areas. As a result, possible compliance issues
and state-of-the-art solutions can be found for those
unexplored areas.
iv. Finally, this article can be a guideline for learning
about the GDPR compliance issues with IoT and
blockchain-based industrial data. From our analysis,
we have observed that IoT is a major area, where
GDPR compliance issues are critical. Since IoT and
blockchain both are essential building blocks of future
industrial applications, findings from this work can
help researchers, enthusiasts and other actors in building ethically sustainable digital services that follow
GDPR recommendations.
VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS

The SLR aimed to synthesize the prior works on the topic
of GDPR compliant blockchains. We collected the related
studies from two major databases and conducted an in-depth
analysis of the studies. This SLR clearly indicated that the
research studies on this topic have been rising. We found
that GDPR articles on data deletion and modification (Article
16 and 17) are among the most discussed compliance issues
for blockchain. Furthermore, we have also observed that the
role distribution of different actors as data controllers and
processors have also been widely discussed in prior literature.
We have identified eight research areas based on our thematic
analysis. Among these themes, we observed IoT and healthcare domains are the most discussed research areas in prior
literature. There are two major limitations of this SLR. First,
we included only peer-reviewed articles in our study. This
means that our approach excluded industry or practitioner
reports, which might provide additional insights into the
topic. Second, we have conducted our searches only in two
databases. We have used citation chaining to find additional
articles. Despite this, we might have missed some important
articles to be considered in this SLR. This limitation can be
addressed in future research by adding additional databases
for searching articles.
