Context Anecdotal reports suggest that the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Privacy Rule (HIPAA Privacy Rule) may be affecting health research
in the United States.

Objective To survey epidemiologists about their experiences with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

ability and Accountability Act
(HIPAA) Privacy Rule was intended to strike a balance between protecting the privacy of individually identifiable health information
and preserving the legitimate use and
disclosure of this information for important social goals.1 Protecting health
information privacy is a longstanding
and widely held goal of the public, legislators, and the research community.2-4 However, many researchers have
expressed concerns that since implementation in April 2003, the Privacy
Rule has adversely affected the progress
of biomedical research.
The Privacy Rule permits health care
provider organizations (“covered entities”) to disclose individually identifiable health information (called protected health information) for research
purposes only if the researcher has obtained from each patient written authorization to access his or her medical record or, if that is impractical, has
obtained a waiver of the authorization
requirement from an institutional review board (IRB). The rule does not require patient authorization (or a waiver)
for the disclosure to researchers of limited data sets (ie, information from
which most of 18 identifiers specified
in the rule have been removed, such as
geographic information related to the

Design, Setting, and Participants Thirteen societies of epidemiology distributed
a national Web-based survey; 2805 respondents accessed the survey Web site and
1527 eligible professionals anonymously answered questions.
Main Outcome Measures Responses related influences such as research delays
and added cost after Privacy Rule implementation, frequency and type of Privacy Rule–
related institutional review board modifications, level of difficulty obtaining deidentified data and waivers, experiences with multisite studies, and perceived participant
privacy benefits under the rule. Respondents ranked their perceptions of Privacy Rule
influence on 5-point Likert scales.
Results A total of 875 (67.8%) respondents reported that the HIPAA Privacy Rule
has made research more difficult at a level of 4 to 5 on a Likert scale, in which 5 indicates a great deal of added cost and time to study completion. A total of 684 (52.1%)
of respondents identified a “most affected” protocol. Respondents indicated that the
proportion of institutional review board applications in which the Privacy Rule had a
negative influence on human subjects (participants) protection was significantly greater
than the proportion in which it had a positive influence (P⬍.001).
Conclusion In this national survey of clinical scientists, only a quarter perceived that
the rule has enhanced participants’ confidentiality and privacy, whereas the HIPAA
Privacy Rule was perceived to have a substantial, negative influence on the conduct
of human subjects health research, often adding uncertainty, cost, and delay.

individual, including zip code, and
dates related to the individual, such as
birth dates and admission dates). Such
disclosures do, however, require a data
use agreement between the provider organization and the researcher.
The Privacy Rule also addresses disclosures for public health purposes. The
rule permits disclosures to public health
authorities without the patient’s authorization when required by another law
(such as mandatory reporting) or when
the public health authority is authorized by law to collect or receive the information for the purpose of prevent-

participants involved with the information).
Anecdotal stories in the news media report that epidemiologic and clinical research studies have been halted
or slowed by the Privacy Rule.5-11 A recent review suggested that researchers
are revising or abandoning some
projects.12 Data from single institutions or studies in peer-reviewed journals demonstrate sizeable reductions in
recruitment or increases in cost after the
rule’s implementation.13-15
The lack of generalizable studies designed to assess the rule’s influence limits the ability to assess effects. In January 2007, the Institute of Medicine of
the National Academies, in an attempt
to strengthen the evidence base, commissioned a national survey about the
Privacy Rule among epidemiologists for
the purpose of informing an Institute
of Medicine committee study on this
topic. The survey addressed questions
of the scope, degree, type, and variability of influence from the HIPAA Privacy Rule experienced by epidemiologists conducting research on US human
subjects (participants).
METHODS
Participants

Epidemiologists were surveyed because they are an identifiable professional group of scientists engaged in human subjects research, and their research
often involves the use of medical records. We enlisted support from all professional groups that, to our knowledge, represent US epidemiologists
employed in academia, industry, government, and nongovernment organizations. These included the Section on
Epidemiology, American Academy of Pediatrics; American College of Epidemiology; American College of Preventive
Medicine; American Public Health Association Epidemiology Section; Council on Epidemiology & Statistics, American Diabetes Association; International
Genetic Epidemiology Society; International Society for Environmental Epidemiology; International Society for Pharmacoepidemiology; Society for the
Analysis of African-American Public

Health Issues; Society for Clinical Trials;
Society for Epidemiologic Research; Society for Healthcare Epidemiology; and
Society for Pediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology. Of 14 societies approached,
the 13 listed above participated.
Each society e-mailed all of its active membership and requested that
they respond to a Web-based survey on
the Privacy Rule. E-mail lists are updated annually for purposes of dues collection. Identical e-mails requesting participation in the survey were sent to the
membership of each society 3 times,
once a month during a 3-month period ( January-April 2007). In an effort to avoid response duplication, because a substantial number of
epidemiologists belong to more than 1
organization, we asked respondents,
both in the cover e-mail and in the introduction to the survey, to respond
only once. Individual responses were
submitted anonymously over the Internet such that they could not be
linked to any individual. IRB approval
as an exempt protocol was obtained at
the University of Pittsburgh and reviewed and approved by the National
Academies’ IRB.
The 13 participating epidemiology
societies sent e-mails to a total of 10 347
individual addresses. A cover e-mail
asked professionals engaged in the conduct of US-based human subjects research and who recognized the term
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act or HIPAA to respond.
A total of 2805 individuals accessed the
Web site and 2376 individuals answered a screening question that asked,
“Since HIPAA was implemented in
April 2003, how many new applications involving human subjects have
you submitted to a US IRB?” Respondents answering zero were thanked for
their time and no further questions were
asked. The 1527 respondents who provided a nonzero response are the participants in these analyses.
Survey Content

We asked questions about both positive and negative potential influences
of the HIPAA Privacy Rule, including

the influence of the rule on participant privacy, confidentiality, and public trust, as well as on research procedures. Four general approaches were
used to ascertain information. First, we
asked questions with quantitative response categories. These questions addressed issues such as the frequency of
various types of data collection undertaken by respondents, changes in participant recruitment before and after the
implementation of the Privacy Rule, frequency of IRB modifications secondary to Privacy Rule provisions and their
effect, level of difficulty in obtaining
deidentified data and waivers, familiarity with covered entities’ opting out
of research because of the rule, studies conceived but not submitted to IRBs
because of Privacy Rule concerns, and
perceived effect of the Privacy Rule on
patient confidentiality. We also asked
survey respondents their sex, training, employment, and sources of
funding.
Second, we asked researchers for their
perceptions rated on 5-point Likert scales
aboutissuessuchastheeaseanddifficulty
of conducting research under the Privacy
Rule and the effect the rule has had on
participant privacy/confidentiality.
Third, respondents were asked
whether and under what circumstances their IRB would approve each
of 5 case studies. These involved retrieval of historical identified medical
records, access to identified participants in a hospital-based cancer registry, access to deidentified data in a hospital-based tissue bank, review of
medical records of deceased individuals, and request for a limited data set
(defined by the Privacy Rule) from a
nonaffiliated hospital.
Finally, respondents were asked
open-ended qualitative questions, including a final request: “Please tell us
your stories about HIPAA. These will
help us to understand all of the circumstances in which HIPAA has affected
your research.”
After development of a draft instrument, survey content was vetted and
modified by members of the Institute of
Medicine Committee on Health Re-

search and the Privacy of Health Information: The HIPAA Privacy Rule. In a
pilot phase, questions were distributed
to 10 epidemiologists at the University
of Pittsburgh. After completing the survey, the respondents were debriefed to
identify ambiguities, streamline the instrument, and determine how readily a
typical epidemiologist could answer
questions. After the instrument was finalized, timed pilot tests took 10 to 15
minutes to complete.

lapsed 5-point Likert scales that were
anchored by “none” and “a great deal”
into 1 to 2, 3, and 4 to 5. We chose to
report categories rather than central tendencies to retain the full and unedited
character of the data. We also elected
to report only univariate analyses because our focus is on a description of
the self-reported impact of the Privacy
Rule, rather than predictors of responses.

Statistical Analysis

RESULTS
Responding epidemiologists were predominantly women (59.0%) and mostly
employed in academia (66.0%)
(TABLE 1). The year of their terminal
degree was broadly spread over more
than 30 years. About one-third received 0% to 24% salary from extramural grants/contracts, whereas nearly
40% received 75% to 100% from these
sources.
In reporting general perceptions of
the impact of the HIPAA Privacy Rule,
a majority of respondents reported that
the degree to which the rule made research easier was low, at 1 to 2 (84.1%)
on a 5-point Likert scale anchored at
1 = none, and that the degree to which
the rule made research more difficult
was high, at 4 to 5 (67.8%) on a 5-point
Likert scale anchored at 5=a great deal
(TABLE 2). Almost 40% indicated that
the Privacy Rule increased research
costs in the high range of 4 to 5, and
half indicated that the additional time
added by the rule to complete research projects was high, at 4 to 5. Almost half indicated that the Privacy Rule

had affected research related to public
health surveillance at the high level of
4 to 5. The perceived benefit of the rule
with respect to strengthening public
trust was reported as high, at 4 to 5, by
only 10.5% of respondents, and only
25.9% believed that the rule had enhanced participant confidentiality/
privacy in the high range of 4 to 5.
When asked about the proportion of
IRB applications in which the HIPAA
Privacy Rule had a positive effect on human subjects protection and the proportion in which the rule had a negative effect on human subjects protection,
more respondents indicated that the rule
had a negative than a positive human
subjects influence (P⬍.001) (FIGURE).
Respondents next answered a series
of questions related to specific Privacy
Rule provisions. Nearly half reported
accessing deidentified data without authorization, and 40.2% indicated that
the level of difficulty experienced had
been in the high range of 4 to 5
(TABLE 3). About 40% had attempted
to obtain a waiver, and 30.6% reported the level of difficulty in doing
so was high, at a level of 4 to 5. Of epidemiologists involved in multiinstitutional studies, 76.8% reported
that these protocols elicited Privacy
Rule concerns, and among these protocols, rule concerns resulted in sitespecific variability in 39.6%. A minority of respondents (17.3%) knew of
covered entities unwilling to do clinical research, and a minority (15.6%) reported that an IRB-approved protocol
had not been honored by a covered entity because of Privacy Rule concerns.
As many as 1 in 9 epidemiologists
(11.5%) had conceived of a study but
not submitted it to an IRB because they
thought they could not obtain approval under the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
More than half (52.1%) of respondents identified a particular protocol
most affected by the Privacy Rule and
were asked about these to assess specific logistic hurdles and benefits
(TABLE 4). The frequency of “most affected” protocols was relatively constant each year from 2003 through
2006. Privacy Rule–related modifica-

No one argues the merits of patient protection, only that the guidelines lend
considerable variance in interpretation by IRB and other governing boards
that may preclude a patient from participating in beneficial research.”).
Third, respondents voiced concerns that HIPAA slowed the progress
of research (eg, “In the main, HIPAA
has not prevented any research that I
have desired to pursue. What it has
done is to slow the research enterprise
through its training and compliance elements. I and my staff spend more and
more time doing compliance related
things and less and less time doing actual research.”).
Fourth, some respondents indicated confusion within government
agencies about the demarcation between public health surveillance, which
is often exempt from the Privacy Rule,
and research (eg, “Besides research,
HIPAA has affected basic public health
surveillance for reportable diseases and
has caused much confusion among
healthcare providers that provide us
with that information.”).
COMMENT
We report the results of a national survey of epidemiologists to assess the
influence of the HIPAA Privacy Rule on
human subjects research. The general
perception, expressed by two-thirds of
respondents, was that the rule made
research more difficult, in the high range
of4to5onaLikertscale,wherein5equals
a great deal, adding cost and time to research completion. Half of respondents
identified a most affected protocol.
Previous case reports or singleinstitution/single-study experiences
support these findings. In a comparison of the conduct of a cohort study at
the University of Pittsburgh pre– and
post–Privacy Rule, I previously13 documented that recruitment decreased from
12.4 on average per week (in 1997 to
2001) to 2.5 to 5.7 on average per week
(in 2003). Similar experiences were reported by Armstrong et al14 in 2 cohorts conducted by the University of
Michigan. Before the Privacy Rule, verbal informed consent was obtained at

tions were necessary in 84.8% of protocols, and 37.6% of respondents reported that these modifications
strengthened confidentiality. At the
same time, 67.5% indicated that the
modifications increased recruitment difficulties at a level of 4 to 5.
We presented 5 case studies, each of
which, according to Privacy Rule provisions, should have been allowable
without patient authorization either unconditionally or with a waiver (TABLE 5).
Notable variability in responses within
each case study was evident. The proportion of respondents who believed that
their IRB would disapprove each study
ranged from 4.7% to 20.2%. Another
4.9% to 33.8% believed that their IRB
would unconditionally approve each
study; 13.3% to 26.7% indicated that
they did not know how their IRB would
decide on the particular case.
In the last survey question, we asked
respondents to tell us about their HIPAA
experiences. Four hundred twentyseven respondents wrote comments.
Ninety percent of these included negative comments about the effect of HIPAA
on research, 5% were neutral (the researcher had not been affected or was engaged in only exempt activities), and 5%
were positive (HIPAA clarification was
identified as helpful).
Several themes were evident. First,
researchers expressed frustration and
concern that the implementation of the
Privacy Rule had added patient burden without substantially enhancing
privacy protection, noting that the
Common Rule already incorporates
many protections (eg, “An already cumbersome patient consent form now has
an additional page-and-a-half explaining HIPAA restrictions. This detracts
from the informed consent process pertaining to the more critical issue: the
actual medical risks and benefits of participating.”).
Second, respondents documented
substantial variability between institutions in their interpretation of Privacy
Rule regulations (eg, “HIPAA is confusing for all stakeholders and generally serves as more of an impediment
to clinical research than it should be.

Wolf and Charles15 reported in a before-and-after study of veterans recruited to the Selenium and Vitamin E
Cancer Prevention Trial that implementation of the Privacy Rule resulted in a 72.9% decline in patient accrual and a 3-fold increase in mean

streamlining of HIPAA-compliant procedures, recruitment returned to prerule levels, although time and cost per
recruited participant remained about
30% higher than before implementation of the Privacy Rule.

medical record research increased
throughout the 2000-2003 period from
rare to 199 per year; those requiring full
board approval increased from almost
none to 31 per year. Of protocols requiring full board approval in 2003,
77% were abandoned.
Whether reports of adverse effects on
human health research from the Privacy Rule represent growing pains associated with implementation vs a continuing effect has been debated.17 This
survey documented that the frequency

of most affected applications has been
stable since implementation of the Privacy Rule. Respondents reported that it
was often difficult to obtain waivers and
deidentified data sets, which were intended to allow access to health information in human subjects research without patient authorization. Yet, case
reports show some better understanding of Privacy Rule restrictions over time.
For example, Privacy Rule implementation triggered several California hospitals to restrict research access to the

longstanding rapid case reporting system provided by the California State
Cancer Registry.6 More than a year later,
the University of California reversed its
stance.
Inconsistency among academic institutions in the interpretation of the
Privacy Rule presents an important
challenge.17 Respondents to this survey provided responses widely distributed from no to yes unconditionally to
yes with conditions when asked
whether particular case studies would
be approved by their IRB. Moreover,
many specific instances of perceived institutional variability were documented in the open-response section of
the survey. This suggests either that
IRBs differ in their response to a given
protocol or that investigators vary in
their perceptions of IRB responses,
either of which is an important problem revealed by this survey.
Some concerns previously raised about
the effect of the Privacy Rule on research were reported to occur, but infrequently, including covered entities
dropping out of multicenter consortia
and clinical researchers not even seeking IRB approval for conceived study designs. The survey was not designed to examine the effect of the Privacy Rule on
inclusion of racial/ethnic minorities.
Two concerns not raised in previous research were found in this study.
First, only one quarter of respondents
indicated that the rule enhanced privacy/confidentiality in the Likert high
range of 4 to 5. More globally, respondents perceived that the influence of the
rule on overall research participant protection is more negative than positive.
In their qualitative responses, the length
and complexity of Privacy Rule–
related authorization forms were cited
as complicating understanding of consent/authorization procedures.18 Second, half of respondents indicated that
the Privacy Rule is seriously affecting
research related to public health surveillance. A caveat is that this question did not clarify whether the rule had
a positive or a negative effect. However, in qualitative responses, concern
was voiced that HIPAA might be im-

peding public health surveillance and
confusion was voiced about the line between research and surveillance, 19
which raises the concern that the rule
is affecting surveillance itself. Whether
this poses any threat to combating epidemics and other public health dangers requires investigation.
According to examination of then
current reports and testimony from
knowledgeable parties, the Secretary’s
Advisory Committee on Human Research Protections in 2004 recommended to the Secretary for Health and
Human Services sweeping modifications to the rule to mitigate any adverse affects on research. The Department of Health and Human Services has
not responded to these recommendations.
Strengths of this survey include its national scope and composite of survey
methods. Weaknesses include the likely
bias of clinical researchers in general and
more particularly that of epidemiologists, who require access to large volumes of medical records. A full delineation of the effect of the Privacy Rule on
research requires additional data collection from IRBs, other science professionals, and research participants. Information from these sources would help to
determine whether the effects reported
here are a result of the regulations or local IRB interpretation. Our survey was
not designed to delineate between these
possibilities; instead, it was designed to

describe the degree and type of influence HIPAA is having on research.
Survey respondents might be even
more biased than epidemiologists in gen-

eral in that they may be the individuals
who have had, or have perceived themselves to have had, difficulties with the
rule. It is also possible that some indi-

INFLUENCE OF HIPAA ON HEALTH RESEARCH

viduals submitted duplicate responses
to the online survey. Because individual responses were submitted anonymously over the Internet, we were unable to determine the frequency with
which this occurred, if at all.
Estimation of response bias typically entails measuring nonresponse.
Unfortunately, we could not accurately calculate a response rate for this
survey because a sizeable but unknown number of epidemiologists are
members of more than 1 society, so the
denominator of e-mails sent substantially overestimates the number of independent individuals invited to participate; and epidemiologists not
involved in the conduct of US-based human subjects research or who did not
recognize the term HIPAA according to
the stated purpose of the survey in the
introductory e-mail likely never accessed the Web site.
Finally, this survey did not address
whether the effects reported may
reflect the wishes that now can be
expressed by better informed participants about the use of their health
information and thus are the intended
and laudable goals of the Privacy
Rule.
The acquisition of data is critical to
assessing the benefits and risks of the
HIPAA Privacy Rule. In this first national survey of epidemiologists, one
quarter perceived that the HIPAA Privacy Rule has enhanced participant confidentiality/privacy, whereas the majority reported that the HIPAA Privacy Rule
has added uncertainty, cost, and delay
to the conduct of US research involving human participants.
