The National Academy of Sciences is a private, nonprofit, self-perpetuating society
of distinguished scholars engaged in scientific and engineering research, dedicated
to the furtherance of science and technology and to their use for the general welfare. Upon the authority of the charter granted to it by the Congress in 1863,
the ­ Academy has a mandate that requires it to advise the federal government on
scientific and technical matters. Dr. Ralph J. Cicerone is president of the National
Academy of Sciences.
The National Academy of Engineering was established in 1964, under the charter
of the National Academy of Sciences, as a parallel organization of outstanding
­engineers. It is autonomous in its administration and in the selection of its members,
sharing with the National Academy of Sciences the responsibility for advising the
federal government. The National Academy of Engineering also sponsors engineering programs aimed at meeting national needs, encourages education and research,
and recognizes the superior achievements of engineers. Dr. Charles M. Vest is president of the National Academy of Engineering.
The Institute of Medicine was established in 1970 by the National Academy of
Sciences to secure the services of eminent members of appropriate professions in
the examination of policy matters pertaining to the health of the public. The Institute acts under the responsibility given to the National Academy of Sciences by its
congressional charter to be an adviser to the federal government and, upon its own
initiative, to identify issues of medical care, research, and education. Dr. Harvey V.
Fineberg is president of the Institute of Medicine.
The National Research Council was organized by the National Academy of ­Sciences
in 1916 to associate the broad community of science and technology with the
Academy’s purposes of furthering knowledge and advising the federal government.
Functioning in accordance with general policies determined by the Academy, the
Council has become the principal operating agency of both the National Academy
of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering in providing services to
the government, the public, and the scientific and engineering communities. The
­Council is administered jointly by both Academies and the Institute of Medicine.
Dr. Ralph J. Cicerone and Dr. Charles M. Vest are chair and vice chair, respectively,
of the National Research Council.

Summary

Beyond the HIPAA Privacy Rule:
Enhancing Privacy, Improving
Health Through Research
Ethical health research and privacy protections both provide valuable
benefits to society. Health research is vital to improving human health and
health care—and protecting individuals involved in research from harm and
preserving their rights is essential to the conduct of ethical research. The primary justification for protecting personal privacy is to protect the interests
of individuals. In contrast, the primary justification for collecting personally
identifiable health information for health research is to benefit society. But it
is important to stress that privacy also has value at the societal level because
it permits complex activities, including research and public health activities,
to be carried out in ways that protect individuals’ dignity. It is also important
to note that health research can benefit individuals, for example, when it
facilitates access to new vaccines, therapies, improved diagnostics, and more
effective ways to prevent illness and deliver care.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) developed
a set of federal standards for protecting the privacy of personal health
information under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
of 1996 (HIPAA). The HIPAA Privacy Rule set forth detailed regulations
 The HIPAA Privacy Rule (“Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information: Final Rule”) can be found at 45 Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.) parts 160 and 164.
http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/AdminSimpRegText.pdf (accessed August 2, 2008). A summary of the
HIPAA Privacy Rule, prepared by the HHS Office for Civil Rights, is available at http://www.
hhs.gov/ocr/privacysummary.pdf (accessed August 2, 2008).

BEYOND THE HIPAA PRIVACY RULE

regarding the types of uses and disclosures of individuals’ personally identifiable health information—called “protected health information”—permitted
by “covered entities” (health plans, health care clearinghouses, and health
care providers who transmit information in electronic form in connection
with transactions for which HHS has adopted standards under HIPAA). A
major goal of the HIPAA Privacy Rule is to ensure that individuals’ health
information is properly protected while allowing the flow of information
needed to promote high-quality health care. The HIPAA Privacy Rule also
set out requirements for the conduct of health research.
The Institute of Medicine Committee on Health Research and the Privacy of Health Information (the committee) was charged with two principal
tasks: (1) to assess whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule is having an impact
on the conduct of health research, defined broadly as “a systematic investigation, including research development, testing and evaluation, designed
to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge”; and (2) to propose
recom­mendations to facilitate the efficient and effective conduct of important health research while maintaining or strengthening the privacy protections of personally identifiable health information.
The committee’s conclusion is that the HIPAA Privacy Rule does not
protect privacy as well as it should, and that, as currently implemented,
the HIPAA Privacy Rule impedes important health research. The committee found that the Privacy Rule (1) is not uniformly applicable to all health
research, (2) overstates the ability of informed consent to protect privacy
rather than incorporating comprehensive privacy protections, (3) conflicts
with other federal regulations governing health research, (4) is interpreted
differently across institutions, and (5) creates barriers to research and leads
to biased research samples, which generate invalid conclusions. In addition,
security breaches are a growing problem for health care databases. In developing its recommendations to improve this situation, the committee was
guided by three overarching goals: (1) improve the privacy and data security
of health information; (2) improve the effectiveness of health research; and
(3) improve the application of privacy protections for health research. A
summary of the committee’s recommendations is presented in Box S-1.

SUMMARY

Recommendation I. Develop a New Approach to
Protecting Privacy in All Health Research
The committee’s first and foremost recommendation (Recommendation I) is that Congress should authorize HHS and other relevant federal
agencies to develop a new approach to protecting privacy in health research
that would apply uniformly to all health research. When this new approach
is implemented, HHS should exempt health research from the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The new approach should enhance privacy protections through
improved data security, increased transparency of activities and policies,
and greater accountability, while also allowing important health research
to be undertaken with appropriate oversight. The new approach should do
all of the following:
•
•
•
•
•

•

•

•

Apply to any person, institution, or organization conducting health
research in the United States, regardless of the source of data or
funding.
Entail clear, goal-oriented, rather than prescriptive, regulations.
Require researchers, institutions, and organizations that store
health data to establish strong data security safeguards.
Make a clear distinction between the privacy considerations that
apply to interventional research and research that is exclusively
information based.
Facilitate greater use of data with direct identifiers removed in
health research, and implement legal sanctions to prohibit unauthor­
ized reidentification of information that has had direct identifiers
removed.
Require ethical oversight of research when personally identifiable
health information is used without informed consent. HHS should
develop best practices for oversight that should consider:
o Measures taken to protect the privacy, security, and confidentiality of the data;
o Potential harms that could result from disclosure of the data;
and
o Potential public benefits of the research.
Certify institutions that have policies and practices in place to protect data privacy and security in order to facilitate important largescale information-based research for clearly defined and approved
purposes, without individual consent.
Include federal oversight and enforcement to ensure regulatory
compliance.

BEYOND THE HIPAA PRIVACY RULE

BOX S-1
Summary of the Committee’s Recommendations
The committee’s foremost recommendation is the following:
I. Congress should authorize HHS and other relevant federal agencies to
develop a new approach to protecting privacy that would apply uniformly
to all health research. When this new approach is implemented, HHS
should exempt health research from the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
→ Apply privacy, security, transparency, and accountability obligations to all health
records used in research.
If national policy makers choose to continue to rely on the HIPAA Privacy Rule
rather than adopt a new federal approach (Recommendation I), the committee
recommends the following:
II. HHS should revise the HIPAA Privacy Rule and associated guidance.
A. HHS should reduce variability in interpretations of the HIPAA Privacy
Rule in health research by covered entities, Institutional Review Boards
(IRBs) and Privacy Boards through revised and expanded guidance and
harmonization.
1. HHS should develop a dynamic, ongoing process to increase empirical
knowledge about current “best practices” for privacy protection in responsible
research using protected health information (PHI), and promote the use of
those best practices.
2. HHS should encourage greater use of partially ­deidentified data called “limited

Informative examples for such an approach include Ontario’s Personal
Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA) and a similar model recently
proposed in the United Kingdom. Ontario’s PHIPA shares a number of
similarities with the HIPAA Privacy Rule. In general, both rules require
the holder of personally identifiable health data to get informed consent
(referred to as authorization in the Privacy Rule) before using those data for
a purpose other than providing services directly related to the health care
of the patient. If a researcher wishes to use personally identifiable health
data without getting informed consent, both rules require the researcher
to obtain a waiver of informed consent approved by an independent ethics
board before the study begins.
However, the HIPAA Privacy Rule and PHIPA do have some key differences. One major difference is that unlike the HIPAA Privacy Rule,
which applies privacy obligations unevenly across the health care sector,
PHIPA applies to health information custodians (HICs; e.g., providers,
hospitals, and pharmacies) that collect, use, and disclose personally identifiable health information, as well as to non-HICs that receive personally
identifiable health information from a HIC. Thus, the privacy protections
follow the data.
Another important difference is that PHIPA permits HICs to disclose
personally identifiable health information without consent to “prescribed
persons or entities” that have in place privacy practices, policies, and procedures approved by Ontario’s Information and Privacy Commissioner. The
prescribed persons or entities may then disclose information to ­researchers
either in deidentified form, or in identifiable form with approval of a
Research Ethics Board (Canadian equivalent of an Institutional Review
Board [IRB] or Privacy Board). Consistent with the principle of transparency, a prescribed entity must also make public a description of its functions
and a summary of its practices, policies, and procedures. A similar approach
was recommended in a report commissioned by the United Kingdom’s Prime
Minister on secondary uses of personal information. This report suggested
the creation of “safe harbors,” which have three defining characteristics:
(1) they provide a secure environment for processing personally identifiable
health data, (2) they are restricted to “approved researchers” who meet
relevant criteria, and (3) they implement penalties and allow for criminal
sanctions against researchers who abuse their access to personally identifiable data. The committee believes that such an approach, combined with
strong security measures, offers adequate privacy protections for personally

SUMMARY

identifiable health information in information-based health research, while
greatly expanding research opportunities.
The committee’s new framework entails a two-part practical approach
to protecting health information privacy because there are fundamental
differences between information-based research (e.g., using medical records
or stored biological samples) and direct, interventional human subjects
research. Applying the same human subjects protections in these two different scenarios is neither appropriate nor justifiable. Promoting individual
autonomy is essential when a person’s health care or participation in clinical research is considered. The purpose of informed consent in this type
of research is mainly to protect research participants from physical harm
by providing a description of the potential risks and benefits of the study.
In contrast, in information-based research that relies solely on medical
records and stored biospecimens, the research participant faces no risk of
direct physical harm. In this context, informed consent (authorization) is
intended to ensure that individuals are able to exercise control over their
personal information that is held by third parties, and to give individuals
the right to determine whether their personal information can be used in
a particular research project (or a series of such projects, if consent for
future research is permitted). Because of these fundamental differences
between information-based research and direct, interventional human subjects research, the committee makes a clear distinction between the privacy
considerations that apply to interventional research and research that is
exclusively information based.
First, the committee recommends that all interventional research,
regardless of funding source and support, should be required to comply
with the Common Rule, and all researchers who gain access to personally
identifiable health information as part of the interventional research should
be required to protect that information with strong security measures.
Research participants should be allowed to provide consent for future
research uses of data and biological materials collected as part of the interventional study as long as an IRB reviews and approves the future uses,
ensuring that the new study is not incompatible with the original consent.
Second, the committee recommends that HHS and other relevant federal agencies develop a new approach to uniform, goal-oriented oversight
of information-based research, with a focus on best practices in privacy,
security, and transparency as in PHIPA and the proposed United Kingdom
model. This new approach should include a mechanism by which some
programs or institutions could be certified by HHS or another accrediting body, similar to a prescribed entity as in PHIPA or a safe harbor as in
 The “Common Rule” is the term used by 18 federal agencies who have adopted the same

regulations governing the protection of human subjects of research.

the United Kingdom model. Such entities could then collect and analyze
personally identifiable health information for clearly defined and approved
purposes, without individual consent. Because of the administrative requirements in becoming certified, this option is most appropriate for disease
registries and other very large scale research databases. Certified entities
could also aggregate personally identifiable data from multiple sources, and
then provide data to researchers with direct identifiers removed, under strict
security requirements. This would facilitate greater use of data with direct
identifiers removed in research because the aggregated datasets would be
more complete and thus would lead to more accurate conclusions. To further protect privacy, unauthorized reidentification of information that has
had direct identifiers removed should be prohibited by law, and violators
should face legal sanctions.
In cases where researchers cannot use data with direct identifiers
removed, and personally identifiable health information is needed for
research, approval and oversight by an ethics oversight board should be
required, partially analogous to what is now done under the HIPAA ­Privacy
Rule and PHIPA. This board could perhaps entail a new body specifically formulated to review medical records research, rather than relying
on traditional IRBs that were created to review interventional research.
If researchers seek a waiver of patient consent, an ethics oversight board
should consider the measures the researchers propose to take to protect
the privacy and confidentiality of the data, the potential harms that could
result from disclosure of the data, and the potential public benefits of the
proposed research study. In order to facilitate consistent application of this
option, HHS will need to develop clear guidance and best practices on how
to assess the potential harm, the proposed measures to protect privacy and
confidentiality, and the potential public benefits of a research study, as has
been done under PHIPA.
Although expectations regarding privacy vary among different demographic groups, public opinion polls suggest that a significant portion of the
American public would like to control all access to their medical records
for research via an individual consent mechanism. However, obligations to
implement comprehensive privacy protections—such as security, transparency, and accountability—are independent of patient consent. Moreover,
the committee concluded, based on considerable testimony and other evidence, that a universal requirement for informed consent can lead to invalid
results because of significant differences between patients who do or do not
grant consent, and missed opportunities to advance medical science because
it can be prohibitively costly and difficult to obtain consent for studies that
require analysis of very large datasets. As a result, the committee’s new
framework includes two alternatives to consent that can be used in certain
circumstances (e.g., disclosure to a certified entity and waiver of informed

SUMMARY

consent by an ethics review board), which are intended to facilitate research
that is socially beneficial and to protect privacy through increased security,
transparency, and accountability.
If society seeks to derive the benefits of medical research in the form of
improved health and health care, information should be shared to achieve
that greater good, and governing regulations should support the use of
such information, with appropriate oversight. In the committee’s proposed
new framework, the greater emphasis on ensuring the security protections
of personally identifiable health information (as in the committee’s Recommendation III.A), facilitating research using data with direct identifiers
removed, and ensuring the scientific merits of any proposed research in the
new framework should help to foster its acceptability. Nonetheless, effective
communication with the public about how health research is done and the
value it provides (the committee’s Recommendation III.C) will be important
to address concerns and gain acceptance.
Recommendation II. revise the Privacy
Rule and Associated Guidance
If this comprehensive new approach is not implemented (or, for the
interim while the new framework is being developed), the committee proposes as an alternative that HHS revise the current HIPAA Privacy Rule
and the associated guidance. These revisions would address some of the
problems uncovered during the course of this study.
Recommendation II.A. The committee recommends that HHS develop
guidance materials to reduce variability among IRBs and Privacy Boards
in their interpretation of the HIPAA Privacy Rule as applied to research.
One of the weaknesses in the current privacy protection system is that there
is extreme variability in the regulatory interpretations and approval decisions among IRBs and Privacy Boards. Regulatory language often is not
­easily understandable and is subject to wide interpretation. Thus local IRBs
and Privacy Boards interpret state and federal regulations independently,
resulting in a great deal of variation in how the regulations are implemented. To address this problem, the committee developed four specific
recommendations.
First, HHS should develop a dynamic, ongoing process to increase empirical knowledge about current “best practices” for privacy protection in
responsible research using protected health information (PHI), and promote
use of those best practices. To accomplish this, HHS should regularly convene
consensus development conferences in collaboration with health research
stakeholders to collect and evaluate current practices in privacy protection.
Second, HHS should encourage greater use of partially deidentified
data called “limited datasets” and develop clear guidance on how to set

BEYOND THE HIPAA PRIVACY RULE

up and comply with the associated data use agreements (DUAs) more
efficiently and effectively. Currently, there is pervasive confusion regarding
the conditions of DUAs and how recipients may meet those conditions. As
a result, in some health care settings, the burden of establishing a DUA
prevents research from going forward. At the other extreme, some covered
entities sign DUAs as a matter of course, providing little meaningful privacy
protection to the patient.
Third, HHS should clarify the somewhat artificial distinction it has
made between “research” and “practice” to ensure appropriate IRB and
Privacy Board oversight of PHI disclosures for these closely related activities. This will require HHS to consult with relevant stakeholders to develop
standard criteria for IRBs and Privacy Boards to use when making distinctions between health research and related endeavors, such as public health
practice and quality improvement practices. These criteria should be evaluated regularly by HHS to ensure that the criteria are helpful and producing
the desired outcomes.
Fourth, HHS should simplify the guidance regarding the use of PHI in
activities preparatory to research and harmonize these provisions with the
Common Rule. The committee recommends that all researchers (including
those internal to a covered entity) be required to obtain IRB approval (as
required under the Common Rule) prior to contacting potential research
participants. When making a decision about whether to approve research
projects, the IRB should review and consider the investigator’s plans for
contacting patients, and ensure that the information will be used only
for research projects approved by the IRB and will not be disclosed
elsewhere.
Recommendation II.B. The committee recommends that HHS develop
guidance materials to facilitate more effective use of existing data and
materials for health research and public health purposes. Many institutions
create and maintain databases with patient health information or repositories with biological materials collected from patients. These databases and
biospecimen banks are used for many types of health research, including
studies to understand diseases or to compare patient outcomes following
different treatments. Current interpretations of provisions of the HIPAA
Privacy Rule sometimes make it difficult to effectively use these valuable
resources for health research. The committee developed four specific recommendations to facilitate important health research by maximizing the usefulness of patient data associated with biospecimen banks and in research
databases, thereby allowing novel hypotheses to be tested with existing
data and materials as knowledge and technology improve. The recommendations would align interpretation of the HIPAA Privacy Rule with the
Common Rule on several points, simplify or clarify the relevant processes
in research, and develop new tools for data aggregation.

SUMMARY

First, the committee recommends that HHS develop guidance which
clearly states that individuals can authorize use of PHI stored in databases
or associated with biospecimen banks for specified future research under
the HIPAA Privacy Rule with IRB oversight, as is allowed under the Common Rule. Future uses should be described in sufficient detail to allow
individuals to give informed consent, and researchers should be required
to have IRBs determine that the new research is not incompatible with the
initial consent. Second, the committee recommends that HHS develop clear
guidance for use of a single form that permits individuals to authorize use
and disclosure of health information in a clinical trial and to authorize the
storage of their biospecimens collected in conjunction with the clinical trial.
This will simplify the authorization process for interrelated research activities by integrating all relevant information into one simple document.
Third, the committee recommends that HHS clarify the circumstances
under which DNA samples or sequences are considered PHI. Genetic information does not itself identify an individual in the absence of other identifying information. However, in some circumstances, a person’s genetic code
could be construed as a unique identifier in that it could be used to match a
sequence in another biospecimen bank or databank that does include identifiers. The committee advocates a focus on strong security measures and the
adoption of strict prohibitions and legal sanctions against the unauthorized
reidentification of individuals from DNA sequences, by anyone.
Fourth, HHS should develop a mechanism for linking data from multiple sources so that more useful datasets can be made available for research
in a manner that protects privacy, confidentiality, and security. One way this
could be accomplished, for example, might be through data warehouses
that are certified for the purpose of linking data from different sources. The
organizations responsible for such linking would be required to use strong
security measures and would maintain the details about how the linkage was
done, should another research team need to recreate the linked dataset.
Recommendation II.C. The committee recommends that HHS revise
provisions of the HIPAA Privacy Rule that currently hinder research but
do not provide substantive privacy protections. First, HHS should reform
the requirements for the accounting of disclosures (AOD) of PHI made
for research and public health purposes. Until technology advances make
automatic AOD tracking feasible, affordable, and widely available, the
HIPAA Privacy Rule should permit covered entities to inform patients in
advance that PHI might be used for health research with IRB/Privacy Board
oversight or for public health purposes. As an alternative to AOD, to ensure
transparency, institutions should maintain a list, accessible to the public, of
all studies approved by an IRB/Privacy Board.
In addition, HHS should simplify the criteria that IRBs and Privacy Boards use in determining whether to waive the requirement that

12

BEYOND THE HIPAA PRIVACY RULE

r­ esearchers obtain authorization from each patient whose PHI will be
used in a research study. If HHS decides to retain the current waiver
­criteria, HHS should provide clear and reasonable definitions to the vague
terms used in the waiver criteria (i.e., what constitutes “minimal risk” to
the privacy of individuals and what constitutes “impracticable”), as well
as providing specific case examples. This would be especially helpful for
multi-­institutional studies, which fall under the jurisdiction of multiple
IRBs or Privacy Boards.
Recommendation III. Implement changes
necessary for both policy options
above (Recommendations I and II)
The committee’s last set of recommendations do not directly relate to
the HIPAA Privacy Rule, but should be adopted in order to achieve the
committee’s overarching goals under both policy options described above
(the new framework or revisions to the HIPAA Privacy Rule and associated
guidance).
Recommendation III.A. The committee recommends that all health
research institutions improve the security of personally identifiable health
information. For example, institutions could: appoint a security officer
responsible for assessing data protection needs and implementing solutions
and staff training; make greater use of encryption and other techniques for
data security; include data security experts on IRBs; implement a breach
notification requirement, so that patients may take steps to protect their
identity in the event of a breach; and implement layers of security protection to eliminate single points of vulnerability to security breaches. In addition, the federal government should support (1) the development and use of
genuine privacy-enhancing techniques that minimize or eliminate the collection of personally identifiable data, and (2) standardized self-evaluations
and security audits and certification programs to help institutions achieve
the goal of safeguarding the security of personal health data.
Recommendation III.B. The committee also recommends that HHS—
or, as necessary, Congress—provide reasonable protection against civil suits
brought pursuant to state or federal laws for members of IRBs and Privacy
Boards for decisions made within the scope of their responsibilities under
the HIPAA Privacy Rule and the Common Rule. The limitation on liability
should not include protection for willful and wanton misconduct in reviewing the research, but should instead be reserved for good-faith decisions,
backed by minutes or other evidence. Effective oversight of health research
depends on the recruitment of qualified and knowledgeable volunteers to
serve on IRBs and Privacy Boards. But the increasing workload and complexity of IRB and Privacy Board service have made it difficult to recruit

SUMMARY

and retain knowledgeable IRB members and to ensure time for the ethical
reflection necessary to make appropriate decisions about human research
projects. Moreover, because of the growth over the past decade of lawsuits
naming individual IRB members as defendants, fear of penalties and civil
suits can be a significant deterrent in recruiting qualified volunteers to serve
on IRBs and Privacy Boards.
Recommendation III.C. Finally, the committee recommends that HHS
and researchers take steps to provide the public with more information
about health research. Surveys indicate that the vast majority of Americans
believe health research is important, and they are interested in the findings
of research studies. Yet patients often lack information about how health
research is conducted and are rarely informed about research results that
may have a direct impact on their health. The committee recommends that
researchers inform interested research participants (who granted authorization for a particular study) with a simplified summary of the results at
the conclusion of a research study. HHS should also encourage researchers
to register their trials and other studies in public databases, particularly
when the research is being conducted under a waiver of authorization. In
addition, HHS and the health research community should work to educate
the public about how research is done, and what value it provides. These
recommendations could be accomplished without any changes to HIPAA
or the Privacy Rule by making them a condition of funding for research
grants from HHS and other research sponsors, and by providing additional
funds to cover the cost.

Overview of Conclusions
and Recommendations

Ethical health research and privacy protections both provide valuable
benefits to society. Health research is vital to improving human health and
health care—and protecting individuals involved in research from harm
and preserving their rights is essential to the conduct of ethical research.
The primary justification for protecting personal privacy is to protect the
interests of individuals. In contrast, the primary justification for collecting
personally identifiable health information for health research is to benefit
society. But it is important to stress that privacy also has value at the societal
level because it permits complex activities, including research and public
health activities, to be carried out in ways that protect individuals’ dignity.
It is also important to note that health research can benefit individuals, for
example, when it facilitates access to new therapies, improved diagnostics,
and more effective ways to prevent illness and deliver care.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) developed
a set of federal standards for protecting the privacy of personal health
information under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act of 1996 (HIPAA). The HIPAA Privacy Rule set forth detailed regulations regarding the types of uses and disclosures of individuals’ personally
­identifiable health information—called “protected health information”—
permitted by “covered entities” (health plans, health care clearing houses,
and health care providers who transmit information in electronic form in
connection with transactions for which HHS has adopted standards under

HIPAA). A major goal of the Privacy Rule is to ensure that individuals’
health information is properly protected while allowing the flow of information needed to promote high-quality health care. The Privacy Rule also
set out requirements for the conduct of health research.
The Institute of Medicine (IOM) Committee on Health Research and
the Privacy of Health Information (the committee) was charged with two
principal tasks: (1) to assess whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule is having an
impact on the conduct of health research, defined broadly to include biomedical research, epidemiological studies, and health services research, as well as
studies of behavioral, social, and economic factors that affect health; and
(2) to propose recommendations to enable the efficient and effective conduct
of important health research while maintaining or strengthening the privacy
protections of personally identifiable health information (Box O-1).
The committee’s conclusion is that the HIPAA Privacy Rule does not
protect privacy as well as it should, and that, as currently implemented,
the Privacy Rule impedes important health research. The committee found
that the Privacy Rule (1) is not uniformly applicable to all health research,
(2) overstates the ability of informed consent to protect privacy rather than
incorporating comprehensive privacy protections, (3) conflicts with other
federal regulations governing health research, (4) is interpreted differently
across institutions, and (5) creates barriers to research and leads to biased
research samples, which generate invalid conclusions. In addition, security
breaches are a growing problem for health care databases. In this report,
the committee presents its analysis and findings, along with several recommendations for accomplishing the dual goals of protecting health privacy
while facilitating responsible and beneficial research.
DEFINITIONS
Definition of Privacy and Why Privacy Is Important
The term “privacy” is used frequently, yet there is no universally
accepted definition of the term, and there is considerable confusion about
the meaning, value, and scope of the concept. The focus of the HIPAA
Privacy Rule and the IOM committee’s report are on the privacy of personal health information. In this context, privacy pertains to the collection,
­storage, and use of personal information and addresses the question of who

BOX O-1
Committee Statement of Task
An Institute of Medicine committee will investigate the effects on health research
of the Privacy Rule regulations implementing the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) section on Administrative Simplification and
prepare a report. In conducting the study, the committee will:
1. Consider the range of study types, such as clinical trials, epidemiologic designs,
research using tissue repositories and databases, public health research, and
health services research, to the extent that available data and evidence allow;
2. Consider research carried out by the full range of sponsors: government, public
and private academic, and for-profit sectors, including the pharmaceutical,
biotechnology, and medical device industries;
3. Review provisions of the Privacy Rule relevant to health research, including
those dealing with authorizations and accounting of disclosures of personal
health information, deidentification of data, reviews preparatory to research,
and others, and on reviewing them, may identify provisions that merit priority
attention and analysis;
4. Consider issues of interpretation and implementation of the Privacy Rule, as
well as of harmonization with overlapping provisions of the Common Rule and
Food and Drug Administration regulations, which have existed much longer;
5. Examine the potential impact of the Rule on public health research, on the
recruitment of research subjects for studies, on carrying out research internationally, and on research using data and biomaterials in databases and tissue
repositories; and
6. Consider the needs for privacy of identifiable personal health information and
the value of such privacy to patients and the public.
As data and evidence allow, the needs and benefits of patient privacy will be
balanced against the needs, risks, and benefits of identifiable health information
for various kinds of health research. The committee will formulate recommendations for alterations or retention of the status quo accordingly.

has access to personal information and under what conditions. Issues of
privacy include whether specific types of data about an individual can be
collected at all, as well as the justifications, if any, under which data collected for one purpose can be used for another purpose. Another important
issue in privacy analysis is whether an individual has authorized particular
uses of his or her personal information.
Although privacy is often used interchangeably with the terms “confidentiality” and “security,” they have distinct meanings. Confidentiality,
though closely related to privacy, refers to the obligations of those who
receive information in the context of an intimate relationship to respect the

Beyond the HIPAA Privacy Rule: Enhancing Privacy, Improving Health Through Research

18

BEYOND THE HIPAA PRIVACY RULE

privacy interests of those to whom the data relate and to safeguard that
information. Confidentiality addresses the issue of whether to keep information exchanged in that relationship from being disclosed to third parties.
Thus, for example, confidentiality requires physicians not to disclose information shared with them by a patient in the course of a physician–patient
relationship. Unauthorized or inadvertent disclosures of data gained as part
of an intimate relationship are considered breaches of confidentiality.
Security, as defined by Turn and Ware in 1976, is “the procedural and
technical measures required to (a) prevent unauthorized access, modification, use, and dissemination of data stored or processed in a computer
system, (b) prevent any deliberate denial of service, and (c) to protect the
system in its entirety from physical harm.” Currently existing, commonly
deployed security measures help keep health records safe from unauthorized
use, although no security measure can prevent an invasion of privacy by
individuals who have authority to access a health record.
American society places a high value on a private sphere protected
from intrusion, and the bioethics principle of nonmaleficence requires
safeguarding personal privacy. Breaches of an individual’s privacy and confidentiality may affect a person’s dignity and cause irreparable harm. When
personally identifiable health information is disclosed to an employer,
insurer, or family member, for example, the disclosure can result in stigma,
embarrassment, and discrimination. Safeguarding privacy and confidentiality are also important for both individuals and society. Individuals are less
likely to participate in health research or other socially and individually
beneficial activities, including candid and complete disclosures of sensitive
information to their physicians, if they do not believe their privacy is being
protected. However, it should also be noted that perceptions of privacy vary
among individuals and groups. Information that is considered intensely
private by one person may not be by others. The concept of privacy is also
context specific, and acquires a different meaning depending on the stated
reasons for the information being gathered, the intentions of the parties
involved, as well as the politics, convention, and cultural expectations.
The bioethics principle of respect for persons places importance on individual autonomy or self-determination, which allows indi­viduals to make
decisions for themselves about matters that are important to their own wellbeing. U.S. society also places a high value on individual ­autonomy, and one

way to respect individuals is to ensure that they can make the choice about
when, and whether, personal information (particularly sensitive information) can be shared with others.
Many statutory and regulatory protections of privacy have attempted
to incorporate these values and concerns through emphasis on the principles
of fair information practices, which have been adopted in various forms at
the international, federal, and state levels. The principles of fair information
practices address issues such as data quality, limitations on collection and use,
specification of purpose, security safeguards, openness of practices and policies, individual participation, and accountability. They reflect a broad consensus about the need for standards to protect individual privacy and to facilitate
information flows in an increasingly technology-dependent, global society.
Definition of Health Research and Why Health Research Is Important
Under both the HIPAA Privacy Rule and a federal regulation known
as the Common Rule, “research” is defined as “a systematic investigation,
including research development, testing and evaluation, designed to develop
or contribute to generalizable knowledge.” This is a broad definition that
may include biomedical research, epidemiological studies, and health services research,10 as well as studies of behavioral, social, and economic
­factors that affect health.
Perhaps the most familiar form of health research is the clinical trial
in which patients volunteer to participate in studies to test the efficacy of
new medical interventions. Today, though, an increasingly large portion of
health research is information based. More and more research entails the
analysis of data and biological samples that were initially collected for one
purpose and are now being used for another purpose such as research.11
 The concept of fair information practices originated with the 1973 report of the Secretary’s

Advisory Committee on Automated Personal Data Systems, reporting to the Secretary of the
U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, titled Records, Computers and the Rights
of Citizens, http://epic.org/privacy/hew1973report/ (accessed August 3, 2008).
 The Common Rule is a federal policy for the protection of human subjects adopted by
18 federal agencies and offices. 45 C.F.R. part 46, http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/common.
html (accessed August 3, 2008).
 Epidemiology is the study of the occurrence, distribution, and control of diseases in
populations.
10 Health services research has been defined as a multidisciplinary field of inquiry, both basic
and applied, that examines the use, costs, quality, accessibility, delivery, organization, financing, and outcomes of health care services to increase knowledge and understanding of the
structure, processes, and effects of health services for individuals and populations.
11 The National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics has noted that the term “secondary uses” of health data is ill defined and therefore urged abandoning it in favor of precise
description of each use. Consequently, the IOM committee has chosen to minimize use of the
term in this report.

BEYOND THE HIPAA PRIVACY RULE

In the fields of epidemiology, health services research, and public health
research, the use of existing data to conduct research is common. Existing
data are analyzed to identify patterns of occurrences, determinants, and
the natural history of disease; to evaluate health care interventions and
services; to perform drug safety surveillance; and to perform some genetic
and social studies.
A prime example of the benefits of research using existing biological samples and patients’ records is the development of Herceptin® ­(trastuzumab),
a revolutionary new treatment for some kinds of breast cancer. In addition,
many findings from research using patients’ medical records have changed
the practice of medicine. Examples of how health research based on data
from medical records has informed and influenced national and other policy
decisions abound. Just to cite a few: Research based on data from medical
records underlies the estimate that tens of thousands of Americans die each
year from medical errors in the hospital and has provided valuable information for reducing these medical errors by implementing health information
technology, such as e-prescribing. Medical records research has documented
that disparities and lack of access to care in inner cities and rural areas
results in poorer health outcomes, and has demonstrated that specific preventive services (e.g., mammography) substantially reduce mortality and
morbidity at reasonable costs. Furthermore, such research has established
a causal link between the nursing shortage and patient health outcomes
by documenting that patients in hospitals with fewer registered nurses are
hospitalized ­ longer and are more likely to suffer complications, such as
urinary tract infections and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. As the use of
electronic medical records increases, the pace of medical records research
is accelerating, and the opportunities to use these records to generate new
knowledge about what works in health care are expanding.
The varying methods of health research provide complementary
insights. Although clinical trials can provide important information about
the efficacy and adverse effects of medical interventions by controlling the
variables that could impact the results of the study, feedback from realworld clinical experience is also crucial for comparing and improving the
use of drugs, vaccines, medical devices, and diagnostics. The Food and Drug
Administration’s (FDA’s) approval of a drug for a particular indication, for
example, is based on a series of controlled clinical trials, often with a few
hundred to a few thousand patients. After a drug has received the FDA’s
approval for marketing, however, it may be used by millions of people in
many different contexts. Thus tracking clinical experience with the drug is
important for identifying relatively rare adverse effects and for determining
the effectiveness in different populations or circumstances.
Like privacy, all of these health-related activities provide high value
to society. Collectively, these activities can provide important information

about disease trends and risk factors, outcomes of treatment or public
health interventions, functional abilities, patterns of care, and health care
costs and utilization. They have led to significant discoveries, the development of new therapies, and a remarkable improvement in health care and
public health.12 Thus, they provide a sense of hope for people with chronic,
life-threatening, or fatal conditions. If the health research enterprise is
impeded, or if it is less robust, important societal interests are adversely
affected.
THE HIPAA PRIVACY RULE
The U.S. Congress passed HIPAA in 1996 with the primary goals of
making health care delivery more efficient and increasing the number of
Americans with health insurance coverage.
The HIPAA Privacy Rule was developed by HHS under HIPAA’s
administrative simplification provisions, which mandated the creation of
privacy standards for “protected health information” (PHI) in the absence
of federal legislation. A major goal of the HIPAA Privacy Rule is to ensure
that individuals’ health information is properly protected while allowing
the flow of information needed to promote high-quality health care. Recognizing that patients’ health records also play an important role in health
research, Congress wanted to ensure that the implementation of HIPAA
would not impede health researchers’ continued access to data from health
records. Responding to this objective, HHS attempted to create a system
that mandates privacy protection for individually identifiable health information while allowing important uses of the information in health care
and research.
The HIPAA Privacy Rule sets forth detailed regulations regarding the
types of uses and disclosures of “protected health information,” defined as
“individually identifiable health information” that is held or transmitted by
a “covered entity.” Covered entities are health plans, health care clearinghouses, and health care providers who transmit information in electronic
form in connection with a transaction for which HHS has developed a
standard under HIPAA.13 A covered entity may not use or disclose PHI
except either (1) as the Privacy Rule permits, or (2) as the individual who
is the subject of the information (or the individual’s personal representative) authorizes in writing. The Privacy Rule applies not only to health
information exchanged or stored electronically, but also to PHI held by a

covered entity in any form or media, including electronic, paper, and oral
communications.14
Although the HIPAA Privacy Rule applies to information uses and transactions necessary for the provision of health care, it is also applicable to a
great deal of information used in health research. As already explained, the
data in individuals’ medical records may be important or essential to some
types of health research. When obtaining PHI from a covered entity to use
in their research, health researchers are required to follow the provisions of
the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The Privacy Rule permits a covered entity to use
and disclose PHI for research purposes without an individual’s authorization if the covered entity obtains either (1) documentation that an alteration
or waiver of the individual’s authorization for the use or disclosure of the
information has been approved by an IRB or Privacy Board, or (2) specified
representations from the researchers that the PHI is being used or disclosed
solely for purposes preparatory to research, or for research using only the
PHI of decedents. A covered entity may also use or disclose PHI without
an individual’s authorization if the PHI is contained as part of a “limited
dataset” from which specified direct identifiers have been removed, and the
researcher enters into a data use agreement with the covered entity.
THE COMMITTEE’S CHARGE and the
overarching GOALs of the recomMendations
The sponsors of this study asked the IOM to assess whether the HIPAA
Privacy Rule implemented by HHS is impacting the conduct of health
research, and requested that the IOM committee propose recommendations to facilitate the efficient and effective conduct of important health
research while maintaining or strengthening the privacy protections of
personally identifiable health information. To undertake this task, the IOM
appointed a 15-member committee (Committee on Health Research and the
Privacy of Health Information) with a broad range of expertise and experience covering various fields of health research; privacy of health information; health law, regulation, and ethics; human research protections; health
­center administration; use and protection of electronic health information;
and patient advocacy.
As the study progressed and committee members began thinking about
potential recommendations, they identified three general methods for
improving the current system for safeguarding health information privacy:
14 Under the HIPAA Privacy Rule protected health information excludes education records

covered by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, as amended, 20 U.S.C. 1232(g),
records described at 20 U.S.C. 1232(g)(a)(4)(B)(iv), and employment records held by a covered
entity in its role as employer.

(1) the provision of guidance from HHS and its Office for Civil Rights to
Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), Privacy Boards, institutions, and other
participants and stakeholders, which is the easiest way to achieve changes;
(2) regulatory changes to the HIPAA Privacy Rule provisions, which can
be done via HHS, but is more difficult than providing new guidance; and
(3) statutory changes in HIPAA or other legislation at the federal or state
level, which is the most difficult to accomplish, but may be necessary. The
committee members decided to be as modest as possible in proposing recommendations to facilitate the efficient and effective conduct of important
health research while maintaining or strengthening the privacy protections
of personally identifiable health information, with the goal of making it
easier to effect change if policy makers agree with the proposals.
Ultimately, committee members agreed to make two sets of recommendations. First, the committee proposes a bold, innovative, and more
uniform approach to the dual challenge of protecting privacy while supporting beneficial and responsible research.15 Although a totally new
approach may be harder to implement in the short term than more
incremental changes, it might help to stimulate fresh ideas about the best
ways to protect privacy and improve health research as the nation seeks
the best way to support these two interconnected values over the next
several years. Second, in the event that policy makers decide that HIPAA
was—and continues to be—the most useful model for how to safeguard
privacy in health research, the committee proposes a series of detailed
proposals to improve the HIPAA Privacy Rule and associated guidance.
There is no question that the goals of safeguarding privacy and enhancing health research are sometimes in tension. Stringent measures to safeguard privacy can make it harder to conduct high-quality research, and
research itself can pose a threat to privacy. Yet the committee believes that
there is a synergy between the two, that promoting both is desirable, and
that it is possible to strengthen certain privacy protections while still facilitating important health research.
For that reason, the committee’s intent in developing its recommendations was to advance both privacy and health research interests to the
extent possible. The committee understands that the lines are not neat, the
questions are complex, and the challenges are formidable. Nevertheless,
our recommendations are aimed at strengthening health research regulations and practices that effectively safeguard personally identifiable health
information, while changing provisions of the HIPAA Privacy Rule or
its interpretations that the committee found to be mostly formalistic or
15 Responsible health research is methodologically sound, is scientifically valid, protects
the rights and interests of study subjects, and addresses a question or problem relevant to
improving human health.

i­neffective. They also aim to facilitate data collection and use for beneficial
and high-quality health research, with appropriate oversight, to advance
knowledge about human health.
To facilitate beneficial health research while still ensuring adequate
protection of patient privacy, the committee grounded its recommendations in three fundamental goals: (1) improve the privacy and data security
of health information; (2) improve the effectiveness of health research;
and (3) improve the application of privacy protections for health research
(Box O-2). These three basic goals are discussed further below.

BOX O-2
Three Goals Underlying the Committee’s Recommendations
1. Improve the privacy and data security of health information.
2. Improve the effectiveness of health research.
3. Improve the application of privacy protections for health research.

Improve the Privacy and Data Security of Health Information
In the context of health research, the privacy goal is the commitment to
handle personal information of patients and research participants in accordance with meaningful privacy protections. These protections should include
strong security measures, disclosure of the purposes for which personally
identifiable health information is used (transparency), and legally enforceable
obligations to ensure information is secure and used appropriately (accountability). This commitment extends to everyone who collects, uses, or has
access to personal information of patients and research participants.
Practices of security, transparency, and accountability take on
­extraordinary importance in the health research setting. Researchers and
other data users should disclose clearly how and why personal information is being collected, used, and secured, and should be subject to legally
enforceable obligations to ensure that personal information is used appropriately and securely. In this manner, privacy protection will help to ensure
research participant and public trust and confidence in medical research.
Improve the Effectiveness of Health Research
Research discoveries are central to achieving the goal of extending
the quality of healthy lives. Research into causes of disease, methods for

prevention, techniques for diagnosis, and new approaches to treatment
has increased life expectancy, reduced infant mortality, limited the toll of
infectious diseases, and improved outcomes for patients with heart disease,
cancer, diabetes, and other diseases. Patient-oriented clinical research that
tests new ideas makes medical and public health progress possible.
Today the rate of discovery is accelerating, and science is at the precipice of a remarkable period of investigative promise made possible by new
knowledge about the genetic underpinnings of disease. Genomic research
is opening new possibilities for preventing illness and for developing safer,
more effective medical care that may eventually be tailored for specific individuals. Further advances in relating genetic information to predispositions
to disease and responses to treatments will require use of large amounts of
existing health-related information and stored biological specimens. The
increasing use of electronic medical records will further facilitate the generation of new knowledge through research and accelerate the pace of discovery. These efforts will require broad participation of patients in research
and broad data sharing to ensure that the results are valid and applicable
to different segments of the population. Collaborative partnerships among
communities of patients, their physicians, and teams of researchers to gain
new scientific knowledge will bring tangible benefits for people in this
country and around the world.
Improve the Application of Privacy Protections for Health Research
The HIPAA Privacy Rule was written to provide consistent standards
in the United States for the use and disclosure of PHI by covered entities,
including the use and disclosure of such information for research purposes.
In its current state, however, the HIPAA Privacy Rule is difficult to reconcile
with other federal regulations, including HHS regulations for the protection of human subjects (the Common Rule), FDA regulations pertaining to
human subjects protections,16 and other applicable federal or state laws.
For example, inconsistencies in federal regulations governing the
­deidentification of personal health information, obtaining individual consent for future research, and the recruitment of research volunteers make
it challenging for health researchers to undertake important research
activities while seeking to comply with all these regulations. In addition,
there is substantial variation in the way in which institutions interpret and
apply the Privacy Rule. For example, the way in which IRBs and Privacy
Boards interpret the provisions when making decisions about authorization requirements varies across institutions, and often is quite conservative.
Especially for multisite research and studies that are reviewed by both IRBs

BEYOND THE HIPAA PRIVACY RULE

and Privacy Boards, the inconsistent interpretation and application of the
HIPAA Privacy Rule’s provisions pertaining to research can create barriers
to research and even lead to the discontinuation of ongoing research studies, which squanders the contributions of research participants. Adding
yet another layer of complexity and variability for health researchers is a
lack of clarity in the way the HIPAA Privacy Rule applies to various types
of health research or closely related health care practices. Moreover, there
are significant gaps in who and what is covered by current federal research
regulations. Whether a research activity is subject to the provisions of the
Privacy Rule or the Common Rule depends on a number of factors, including the source of funding, the source of the data, and whether the researcher
meets the definition of a covered entity.
The situation in the United States is in stark contrast to the situation
in most other countries, where uniform regulations apply to all research
conducted in the country. The committee believes a new direction is needed,
with a more uniform approach to patient protections, including privacy, in
health research. Improved clarity, harmonization, and uniform application
of regulations governing health research are needed to align the interests
and understandings of the research community, the custodians of PHI, and
other stakeholders such as patients, so that implementation of the privacy
protections in health research can be achieved with acceptability to all.
THE COMMITTEE’s RECOMMENDATIONS
The IOM Committee on Health Research and the Privacy of Health
Information developed several recommendations with the intent of strengthening the privacy protections of personally identifiable health information and
facilitating the efficient and effective conduct of beneficial health research. A
summary of the committee’s recommendations is presented in Box O-3.
The committee’s first and foremost recommendation (Recommendation I) is that Congress should authorize HHS and other relevant federal
agencies to develop a new approach to ensuring privacy that would apply
uniformly to all health research in the United States. When this new approach
is implemented, HHS should exempt health research from the HIPAA Privacy
Rule. This new approach, separate from the HIPAA Privacy Rule, should
ensure privacy in health research by emphasizing security, accountability, and
transparency while also allowing important health research to be undertaken
with appropriate oversight. If national policy makers decide that the HIPAA
Privacy Rule has been, and continues to be, a useful model for safeguarding
privacy in health research, the committee also proposes as an alternative
that HHS revise the current HIPAA Privacy Rule and the associated guidance. These revisions, which could also be implemented in the interim while
a new, comprehensive approach is being developed, would address many of

the problems uncovered during the course of this study. HHS should develop
guidance materials to reduce variability among IRBs and Privacy Boards
in their interpretation of the HIPAA Privacy Rule as applied to research
(Recommendation II.A); develop guidance materials to facilitate more effective use of existing data and materials for health research and public health
purposes (Recommendation II.B); and revise some provisions of the HIPAA
Privacy Rule that currently hinder research but that do not provide meaningful privacy protections (Recommendation II.C). The committee’s last set of
recommendations, though not directly related to the HIPAA Privacy Rule,
should be adopted in order to achieve the committee’s overarching goals. The
committee recommends that all health research institutions improve the security of personally identifiable health information (Recommendation III.A),
that HHS—or, as necessary, Congress—provide reasonable protection to IRB
and Privacy Board members for good faith decisions to encourage service on
IRBs (III.B), and that HHS and researchers take steps to disseminate health
research results more broadly, and to inform the public about the nature of
health research and its value to individuals and society as a whole (Recommendation III.C). Adopting this set of recommendations will be important
regardless of whether Option I or II is implemented.
In the remaining pages of this overview, the abbreviated recommendations of the IOM committee, shown in Box O-3, are presented in fuller
detail.
I. Develop a New Approach to Protecting Privacy in All Health Research
Background
The primary justification for including research provisions in the HIPAA
Privacy Rule was to remedy perceived shortcomings of federal privacy protections in health research under the Common Rule, but the HIPAA Privacy
Rule has numerous limitations of its own. In proposing the Privacy Rule,
HHS acknowledged that, ideally, it would have preferred to regulate health
researchers directly by extending the protections of the Common Rule to
research that is not federally supported and by imposing additional criteria
for the waiver of patient authorization for the use of personally identifiable
health information in research.17 But HHS recognized that it did not have
the authority to do this. For that reason, HHS attempted to protect the
health information released to researchers indirectly (but within the scope

BOX O-3
Summary of the Committee’s Recommendations
The committee’s foremost recommendation is the following:
I. Congress should authorize HHS and other relevant federal agencies to
develop a new approach to protecting privacy that would apply uniformly
to all health research. When this new approach is implemented, HHS
should exempt health research from the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
→ Apply privacy, security, transparency, and accountability obligations to all health
records used in research.
If national policy makers choose to continue to rely on the HIPAA Privacy Rule
rather than adopt a new federal approach (Recommendation I), the committee
recommends the following:
II. HHS should revise the HIPAA Privacy Rule and associated guidance.
A. HHS should reduce variability in interpretations of the HIPAA Privacy
Rule in health research by covered entities, IRBs, and Privacy Boards
through revised and expanded guidance and harmonization.
1. HHS should develop a dynamic, ongoing process to increase empirical
knowledge about current “best practices” for privacy protection in responsible
research using protected health information (PHI), and promote the use of
those best practices.
2. HHS should encourage greater use of partially ­deidentified data called “limited
datasets” and develop clear guidance on how to set up and comply with the
associated data use agreements more efficiently and effectively, in order to
enhance privacy in research by expanding use and usability of data with direct
identifiers removed.
3. HHS should clarify the distinctions between “research” and “practice” to ensure
appropriate IRB and Privacy Board oversight of PHI disclosures for these
activities.
4. HHS guidance documents should simplify the HIPAA Privacy Rule’s provisions
regarding the use of PHI in activities preparatory to research and harmonize
those provisions with the Common Rule, in order to facilitate appropriate
IRB and Privacy Board oversight of identification and recruitment of potential
research participants.
B. HHS should develop guidance materials to facilitate more effective
use of existing data and materials for health research and public health
purposes.
1. HHS should develop guidance that clearly states that individuals can authorize use of PHI stored in databases or associated with biospecimen banks
for specified future research under the HIPAA Privacy Rule with IRB/Privacy

OVERVIEW OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Board oversight, as is allowed under the Common Rule, in order to facilitate
use of repositories for health research.
2. HHS should develop clear guidance for use of a single form that permits individuals to authorize use and disclosure of health information in a clinical trial
and to authorize the storage of their biospecimens collected in conjunction
with the clinical trial, in order to simplify authorization for interrelated research
activities.
3. HHS should clarify the circumstances under which DNA samples or sequences
are considered PHI, in order to facilitate appropriate use of DNA in health
research.
4. HHS should develop a mechanism for linking data from multiple sources so
that more useful datasets can be made available for research in a manner that
protects privacy, confidentiality, and security.
C. HHS should revise provisions of the HIPAA Privacy Rule that entail heavy
burdens for covered entities and impede research without providing substantive improvements in patient privacy.
1. HHS should reform the requirements for the accounting of disclosures of PHI
for research.
2. HHS should simplify the criteria that IRBs and Privacy Boards use in making
determinations for when they can waive the requirements to obtain authorization from each patient whose PHI will be used for a research study, in order to
facilitate appropriate authorization requirements for responsible research.
Regardless of whether Recommendation I or II is implemented, the following recommendations, which are independent of the Privacy Rule, should be adopted:
III. Implement changes necessary for both policy options above (Recommendations I and II).
A. All institutions (both covered entities and non-covered entities) in the
health research community should take strong measures to safeguard
the security of health data.
→ HHS should also support the development and use of new security technologies and self-evaluation standards.
B. To encourage service on Institutional Review Boards, HHS—or, as necessary, Congress—should provide reasonable protection against civil suits
for members of Institutional Review Boards and Privacy Boards who
serve in good faith.
→ But no protection for willful or wanton misconduct.
C. HHS and researchers should take steps to provide the public with more
information about health research by:
1. Disseminating research results to study participants and the public.
2. Educating the public about how research is done and what value it provides.

of its limited authority) by imposing restrictions on information disclosures
by covered entities. The National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics
(NCVHS) and others have noted the limitations of the HIPAA Privacy
Rule and have called for stronger protections of health privacy—notably,
by expanding the purview of the Privacy Rule beyond the current covered
entities.
The IOM committee believes an even bolder change is needed. The
number of studies using medical records to address important questions
about health and disease is likely to increase with the growing availability
of electronic records. As the volume and importance of digital personal
health data increase exponentially, the public can be expected to heighten
demands for a legal framework that provides meaningful safeguards to
protect personally identifiable health information in the health research setting. Thus, the IOM committee recommends developing a new framework
to both protect individuals’ privacy and facilitate responsible and beneficial
health research.
Recommendation I: Congress should authorize HHS and other relevant federal agencies to develop a new approach to protecting privacy
in health research that would apply uniformly to all health research.
When this new approach is implemented, HHS should exempt health
research from the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The new approach should
enhance privacy protections through improved data security, increased
transparency of activities and policies, and greater accountability while
also allowing important health research to be undertaken with appropriate oversight. The new approach should do all of the following:

•

Apply to any person, institution, or organization conducting health
research in the United States, regardless of the source of data or
funding.
Entail clear, goal-oriented, rather than prescriptive, regulations.
Require researchers, institutions, and organizations that store
health data to establish strong data security safeguards.
Make a clear distinction between the privacy considerations that
apply to interventional research and research that is exclusively
information based.
Facilitate greater use of data with direct identifiers removed in
health research, and implement legal sanctions to prohibit unauthor­
ized reidentification of information that has had direct identifiers
removed.
Require ethical oversight of research when personally identifiable
health information is used without informed consent. HHS should
develop best practices for oversight that should consider:

Rationale
The committee concluded that the HIPAA Privacy Rule impedes important health research and does not protect privacy as well as it should.
Rather than offering an effective and comprehensive approach to solving
the real problems of protecting privacy while ensuring the vitality of the
national research agenda, the Privacy Rule often focuses on formalistic
issues. A new approach to protecting the privacy of personally identifiable
information used in health research should both provide strong and effective protection for often-sensitive personally identifiable health information
and facilitate scientific discovery and medical innovation necessary to save
lives and enhance the quality of the public’s health. It should do so in a
way that does not burden individuals with a flurry of health privacy notices
and consent forms, or burden our health care system with a new level of
bureaucracy and expense.
A new framework developed by HHS and other relevant agencies
that emphasizes privacy, security, accountability, and transparency and is
applicable to all health research in the United States would eliminate confusion, reduce variability, facilitate responsible research, and enhance trust in
the research enterprise. Clear and simple regulations that are less subject
to varying interpretation by ethical oversight boards, as well as federal
oversight and enforcement of regulatory compliance, will be important to
consistently and efficiently ensure privacy and instill trust while enabling
important research.
The committee favors an approach in which both ethical health
research and privacy protections are supported. Informative examples for
such an approach include Ontario’s Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA)18 and a similar model recently proposed in the United
18 Personal Health Information Protection Act, Statutes of Ontario 2004, Ch. 3, Schedule

A; Ontario Regulation 329/04.

BEYOND THE HIPAA PRIVACY RULE

Kingdom.19 Ontario’s PHIPA shares a number of similarities with the
HIPAA Privacy Rule. In general, both rules require the holder of personally
identifiable health data to obtain informed consent (referred to as authorization in the Privacy Rule) before using those data for a purpose other
than providing services directly related to the health care of the patient.
If a researcher wishes to use personally identifiable health data without
obtaining informed consent, both rules require the researcher to obtain
a waiver of informed consent approved by an independent ethics board
before the study begins.
However, the HIPAA Privacy Rule and PHIPA do have some key differences. One major difference is that unlike the HIPAA Privacy Rule,
which applies privacy obligations unevenly across the health care sector,
PHIPA applies to health information custodians (HICs; e.g., providers,
hospitals, and pharmacies) that collect, use, and disclose personally identifiable health information, as well as to non-HICs that receive personally
identifiable health information from a HIC. Thus, the privacy protections
follow the data.
Another important difference is that PHIPA permits HICs to disclose
personally identifiable health information without consent to “prescribed
persons or entities,” who must have in place practices, policies, and procedures approved by Ontario’s Information and Privacy Commissioner
to protect the privacy and confidentiality of personally identifiable health
information it receives and maintains. The prescribed persons or entities
may then disclose information to researchers either in deidentified form, or
in identifiable form with approval of a Research Ethics Board (Canadian
equivalent of an IRB or Privacy Board). Consistent with the principle of
transparency, a prescribed entity must also make public a description of its
functions and a summary of its practices, policies, and procedures. A similar
approach to prescribed entities was recommended in a report commissioned
by the United Kingdom’s Prime Minister on secondary uses of personal
information. This report suggested the creation of “safe harbors,” which
have three defining characteristics: (1) they provide a secure environment
for processing personally identifiable health data, (2) they are restricted
to “approved researchers” who meet relevant criteria, and (3) they implement penalties and allow for criminal sanctions against researchers who
abuse their access to personally identifiable data. The committee believes
that such an approach, combined with strong security measures, offers
adequate privacy protections for personally identifiable health information
in information-based health research, while greatly expanding research
opportunities.

OVERVIEW OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Health research increasingly relies on the review of information about
patients’ actual experiences with treatments to determine the risks and
benefits of drugs and other therapies, in addition to traditional interventional and comparative clinical trials with patients. Regulations under
a new approach to ensuring privacy in health should acknowledge the
fact that research based exclusively on information (e.g., using medical
records or stored biological samples) is not the same as direct, interventional human subjects research. For that reason, applying the same human
subjects protections in these two different scenarios is neither appropriate
nor justifiable. Promoting individual autonomy is essential when a person’s
health care or participation in clinical research is considered. The purpose
of informed consent in this type of research is mainly to protect research
participants from physical harm by providing a description of the potential
risks and benefits of the study. In contrast, in information-based research
that relies solely on medical records and stored biospecimens, the research
participant faces no risk of direct physical harm. In this context, informed
consent (authorization) is intended to ensure that individuals are able to
exercise control over their personal information that is held by third parties, and to give individuals the right to determine whether their personal
information can be used in a particular research project (or a series of such
projects, if consent for future research is permitted).
Because of these fundamental differences between information-based
research and direct, interventional human subjects research, the committee
suggests a two-part practical approach to protecting health information
privacy. First, all interventional research, regardless of funding source and
support, should be required to comply with the Common Rule and all
researchers who gain access to personally identifiable health information
as part of the interventional research should be required to protect that
information with strong security measures. Research participants should
be allowed to provide consent for future research uses of data and biological materials collected as part of the interventional study as long as an IRB
reviews and approves the future uses, ensuring that the new study is not
incompatible with the original consent.
Second, a new approach to uniform, goal-oriented oversight of
information-based research should be developed by HHS and other relevant federal agencies, with a focus on best practices in privacy, security,
and transparency as in PHIPA and the proposed United Kingdom model.
This new approach should include a mechanism by which some programs
or institutions could be certified by HHS or another accrediting body,
similar to a prescribed entity as in PHIPA or a safe harbor as in the United
Kingdom model. Such entities could then collect and analyze personally
identifiable health information for clearly defined and approved purposes,
without individual consent. Because of the administrative requirements in

BEYOND THE HIPAA PRIVACY RULE

becoming certified, this option is most appropriate for disease registries
and other very large scale research databases. Certified entities could also
aggregate personally identifiable data from multiple sources, and then provide data to researchers with direct identifiers removed, under strict security
requirements. This would facilitate greater use of data with direct identifiers removed in research because the aggregated datasets would be more
complete and thus would lead to more accurate conclusions. To further
protect privacy, unauthorized reidentification of information that has had
direct identifiers removed should be prohibited by law, and violators should
face legal sanctions.
In cases where researchers cannot use data with direct identifiers
removed, and personally identifiable health information is needed for
research, approval and oversight by an ethics oversight board should be
required, partially analogous to what is now done under the HIPAA Privacy
Rule and PHIPA. This oversight board could perhaps entail a new body specifically formulated to review medical records research, rather than relying
on traditional IRBs that were created to review interventional research. If
researchers seek a waiver of patient consent, an ethics oversight board should
consider the measures to be taken to protect the privacy and confidentiality
of the data, the potential harms that could result from disclosure of the data,
and the potential public benefits of the proposed research study. In order
to facilitate consistent application of this option, HHS will need to develop
clear guidance and best practices on how to assess the potential harm, the
proposed measures to protect privacy and confidentiality, and the potential
public benefits of a research study, as has been done under PHIPA.
There is a great deal of variability in whether and how IRBs and other
ethical oversight boards consider the public benefit and scientific merit of
research proposals. But the first rule of ethical research is that the research
must have scientific value—meaning that it addresses an important question of human health and is designed and conducted using methodology
that is appropriate and rigorous. The scientific merit of research varies
by project, just as the potential risk to privacy of research varies across
different ­ protocols. The committee believes that when making decisions
about whether a research protocol that entails the disclosure of personally
identifiable information should go forward, ethical oversight boards should
take all of these factors—potential risks/harms to research participants’ privacy as well as scientific merit and potential public benefit of the research
­proposal—into consideration.
A previous IOM committee on Assessing the System for Protecting
Human Research Subjects recommended that “human research participant
protection programs” use distinct mechanisms for initial reviews of scientific merit and that these reviews should precede and inform the comprehensive ethical review of research studies. Ethical oversight board members

themselves may not have the expertise to assess the merit of diverse research
studies, but they should have access to evaluations by scientific review committees or funder peer review panels, which would help them assess the
anticipated benefits of a proposed research project.
Although expectations regarding privacy vary among different demographic groups, public opinion polls suggest that a significant portion of the
American public would like to control all access to their medical records
for research via an individual consent mechanism. However, obligations to
implement comprehensive privacy protections—such as security, transparency, and accountability—are independent of patient consent. Moreover, the
committee concluded, based on considerable testimony and other evidence,
that a universal requirement for informed consent can lead to invalid results
because of significant differences between patients who do or do not grant
consent, and to missed opportunities to advance medical science because it
can be prohibitively costly and difficult to obtain consent for studies that
require analysis of very large datasets. As a result, the committee’s new
framework includes two alternatives to consent that can be used in certain
circumstances (e.g., disclosure to a certified entity and waiver of informed
consent by an ethics review board), which are intended to facilitate research
that is socially beneficial and to protect privacy through increased security,
transparency, and accountability.
If society seeks to derive the benefits of medical research in the form of
improved health and health care, information should be shared to achieve
that greater good, and governing regulations should support the use of such
information, with appropriate oversight. In the committee’s proposed new
framework, the greater emphasis on ensuring the security protections of
personally identifiable health information, facilitating research using data
with direct identifiers removed, and ensuring the scientific merits of any
proposed research in the new framework should help to foster its acceptability. Nonetheless, effective communication with the public about how
health research is done and the value it provides (the committee’s Recommendation III.C below) will be important to address concerns and gain
acceptance.
The committee’s proposal for a new approach to ensuring privacy in
health research that is uniformly applicable to all health research in the
United States is especially timely because Congress has shown considerable
interest in producing new legislation to facilitate the implementation of a
nationwide health information technology system. Such a system has been
hailed as a means of addressing rising health care costs and improving the
quality and efficiency of health care, but privacy concerns are emerging as a
primary obstacle to the implementation of such a nationwide system. Some
legislative proposals would follow the HIPAA model of privacy protections,
while others would require different or additional approaches to ensure

BEYOND THE HIPAA PRIVACY RULE

the privacy of electronic health records. A nationwide health information
technology system has the potential to accelerate health research by making large amounts of health data available to study and thus could lead to
major advances in medicine. Nevertheless, caution is warranted in developing new regulations because the adoption of new, restrictive regulations
might actually impede health research, to the great detriment of patients
and society.
If Recommendation I is not implemented and the nation continues to
rely on the HIPAA Privacy Rule for protecting privacy in health research,
the committee proposes an alternative set of recommendations (Recommendations II.A–C) that could address some of the problems uncovered
during the course of this study, by improving the HIPAA Privacy Rule and
associated guidance.
II. Revise the Privacy Rule and Associated Guidance
Recommendation II.A: HHS should reduce variability in interpretations of the HIPAA Privacy Rule in health research by covered entities,
IRBs, and Privacy Boards through revised and expanded guidance and
harmonization.
Background
One of the weaknesses in the current privacy protection system is that
there is extreme variability in the regulatory interpretations and approval
decisions among IRBs and Privacy Boards. Regulatory language often is not
easily understandable and is subject to wide interpretation. Thus local IRBs
and Privacy Boards interpret state and federal regulations independently,
resulting in a great deal of variation in how the regulations are implemented.
For example, projects that are similar in design and intent may be granted
a waiver of individual authorization by some IRBs and Privacy Boards, but
not others, on the basis of differing interpretations of the Privacy Rule’s
waiver criteria. In addition, some IRBs and Privacy Boards may conflate
the Common Rule and Privacy Rule, or apply the research provisions of the
Privacy Rule to activities for which they are not applicable, such as public
health practice or the operation of cancer registries.
Furthermore, in the case of the HIPAA Privacy Rule, covered entities
that disclose PHI are regulated, not the health researchers who receive
the information. As a result, covered entities, as well as IRBs and Privacy
Boards, may be reluctant to permit disclosures of PHI that would allow
health research to go forward, even in situations where it is ethically and
legally justified. Lacking sufficient guidance from HHS, IRBs and Privacy
Boards sometimes interpret the HIPAA Privacy Rule too conservatively out

OVERVIEW OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

37

of concern that a particular health research activity might result in institutional noncompliance with the Privacy Rule.
HHS intended to allow IRBs and Privacy Boards to have some local
control in implementing and interpreting the HIPAA Privacy Rule as it
applies to the use and disclosure of PHI for research. The committee’s
recommendations below are intended not to reduce the decision-making
powers and flexibility of local IRBs and Privacy Boards, but rather to make
it easier for IRBs and Privacy Boards to review research proposals fairly
and quickly. Additional guidance and clarification from HHS on the specific
points listed below, along with specific case examples to help delineate what
is or is not permissible under the Privacy Rule, would make it easier for
IRBs and Privacy Boards to make the appropriate review decisions.
Recommendation II.A.1: HHS should develop a dynamic, ongoing
process to increase empirical knowledge about current “best practices”
for privacy protection in responsible research using PHI, and promote
use of those best practices.
•

•

HHS should regularly convene consensus development conferences
in collaboration with health research stakeholders to collect and
evaluate current practices in privacy protection in order to identify
and disseminate best practices.
Stakeholders can then enable and encourage researchers to use
these best practices in designing and conducting research involving
the use of PHI.

Rationale
There are many diverse approaches to health research. The broad array
of methods and data sources for such research presents a challenge to IRBs
and Privacy Boards that must determine how various state and federal regulations apply to each research protocol. Uncertainty about how the various
regulations apply to a given protocol can lead to overly conservative decisions by these boards, making it more difficult for some important health
research to go forward. For example, some covered entities misinterpret the
Privacy Rule by requiring researchers to obtain authorization from next of
kin in order to access the PHI of decedents, which is not required under
the provisions. Such factors contribute to the tremendous variability in the
decisions made by IRBs and Privacy Boards.
Current guidance from HHS addresses only what is permissible under
the HIPAA Privacy Rule; the guidance does not identify best practices. A
dynamic, ongoing process for the identification and dissemination of best
practices in privacy protection for various types of health research by HHS

38

BEYOND THE HIPAA PRIVACY RULE

would facilitate reviews by IRBs and Privacy Boards and lead to more
consistent and appropriate decisions. HHS guidance materials with best
practices and models or templates for things such as the patient authorization form, waiver of authorization form, data use agreements, and business
associate agreements would make it easier for investigators to appropriately
design research projects and put institutions at ease about decisions their
IRBs and Privacy Boards make with regard to privacy concerns. Such guidance materials should be written as clearly and simply as possible, using
an inclusive, dynamic, and transparent development process, and should
override all prior guidance documents.
The committee believes that a proactive role by HHS in disseminating
guidance changes to IRBs and Privacy Boards is essential. This endeavor
could perhaps be accomplished as an activity of the National Institutes of
Health Roadmap for Medical Research under the direction of the HHS
Office for Civil Rights. An informative precedent for the dissemination
efforts might be the Health Resources and Services Administration’s development of the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) Guidebook,20 an
activity established through Title IV of the Healthcare Quality Improvement
Act of 1986. The NPDB Guidebook, which is frequently updated, provides
many case examples of what should be done in various situations.
Stakeholders—including researchers; research institutions, IRBs, and
Privacy Boards; sponsors of research; public health practitioners and agencies; patient and consumer organizations; and privacy experts—could have
considerable influence on the adoption of best practices once they have been
identified, so they could help to make privacy protections and IRB/Privacy
Board decisions more uniform. For example, Requests for Proposals and
other funding mechanisms could be more instructive on the requirements
for the protection of privacy.
Many academic researchers depend on their ability to procure funding
from a source external to their institutions, and research sponsors have obligations to protect research participants. Thus, major nonfederal funders of
health research could be a powerful force for adherence to ethical guidelines
even in the absence of strong federal regulations and enforcement. Organizations whose primary missions are focused on promoting responsible and
ethical research—such as PRIM&R (Public Responsibility in Medicine and
Research) and the Association for the Accreditation of Human Research
Protection Programs, Inc., which serve as primary educational vehicles for
IRB professionals and offer certification programs—could also contribute
much to this dynamic and ongoing process. Increased participation in these

organizations by research investigators in particular could extend understanding of regulatory requirements and foster national discourse about
issues of interpretation and application of the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
Recommendation II.A.2: HHS should encourage greater use of partially deidentified data called “limited datasets” and develop clear
guidance on how to set up and comply with the associated data use
agreements more efficiently and effectively, in order to enhance privacy
in research by expanding use and usability of data with direct identifiers removed.
Rationale
The HIPAA Privacy Rule and the Common Rule both exempt from
their provisions research using health data from which personal identifiers
have been removed. Because the two rules define personally identifiable
information and deidentification differently, however, there is a discrepancy
between what research involving existing data is exempt from the Common
Rule and what research is exempt from the Privacy Rule.
The standard for deidentification as defined in the Common Rule is
that the identity of the subject may not be readily ascertained by the health
researcher (e.g., “anonymized” datasets with no direct identifiers included).21
Thus, health research using information recorded in such a manner that subjects cannot be readily identified is exempt from the Common Rule.22
Under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, there are two ways to deidentify health
information so that it is exempt from the Privacy Rule. One is to remove
18 specified identifiers that identify or could provide a reasonable basis to
identify an individual, including both direct identifiers (e.g., name, address,
medical records number, Social Security number, health plan beneficiary
number) and indirect identifiers (e.g., dates of service and geographic subdivisions smaller than a state).23 The second way is to have a qualified statistician determine that the risk is very small that any identifiers present on a
given data file could be used alone, or in combination with other available
information, to identify an individual.24
This discrepancy between deidentification standards under the two
rules can give rise to situations in which research with anonymized data
that is exempt from IRB oversight under the Common Rule may still

require a decision by an IRB or a Privacy Board to determine if a waiver
of individuals’ authorization of disclosure for the use of their information
for research purposes is appropriate under the Privacy Rule. However, IRBs
have not had to review these protocols in the past, and they may have difficulty in making appropriate decisions about waivers.
The HIPAA Privacy Rule’s restrictions put greater emphasis on the possibility that deidentified health data could be reidentified using publicly available databases. Record linkage technology has advanced rapidly in the past
10 years, making reidentification of data easier now than when the Common
Rule was implemented. Yet many researchers maintain that removing all 18
data categories required by the HIPAA Privacy Rule can render a dataset
unusable for research. Several organizations—including the Secretary’s Advisory Committee on Human Research Protections (SACHRP), NCVHS, and
the Association of American Medical Colleges—have recommended changing the HIPAA Privacy Rule to reduce the number of identifiers that must be
removed for a dataset to be considered deidentified and thus exempt from
IRB and Privacy Board oversight if used in health research. Some elements
of the 18 identifiers (e.g., ZIP Codes, geographic subdivisions, and dates
of service or tissue collection) do not directly identify individuals, and are
essential for some types of health research, such as epidemiology or studies
of disease incidence.
In 2002, in response to the concerns that had been raised, HHS modified the HIPAA Privacy Rule to create a category of partially deidentified
data called the “limited dataset,” in which health information that is
stripped of the 16 most direct identifiers can be used and disclosed for
research without obtaining individuals’ authorization or an IRB/Privacy
Board waiver if the covered entity enters into a data use agreement (DUA)
with the recipient of the data.25 Geographic subdivisions (other than street
addresses) and dates and other numbers, characteristics, or codes not listed
as direct identifiers in the regulation can be included in a limited dataset,
making it more useful for research.
Currently, however, there is pervasive confusion regarding the conditions of DUAs and how recipients may meet those conditions. As a result,
in some health care settings, the burden of establishing a DUA prevents
research from going forward. However, at the other extreme, some covered
entities sign DUAs as a matter of course, providing little meaningful privacy
protection to the patient. The committee recommends that HHS ameliorate
this situation by issuing clear guidance on how to set up and comply with
data use agreements more efficiently and effectively, with a goal-oriented
focus on the safeguards that researchers should use to protect individuals’
privacy.

Recommendation II.A.3: HHS should clarify the distinctions between
“research” and “practice” to ensure appropriate IRB and Privacy
Board oversight of PHI disclosures for these activities.
•

HHS should consult with relevant stakeholders to develop standard
criteria for IRBs and Privacy Boards to use when making distinctions between health research and related endeavors such as public
health practice and quality improvement practices. These criteria
should be evaluated regularly by HHS to ensure that the criteria
are helpful and producing the desired outcomes.

Rationale
The HIPAA Privacy Rule makes a somewhat artificial distinction
between health research and some closely related activities, such as public
health and quality improvement activities, which also may involve collection and analysis of PHI. Under the Privacy Rule (as well as the Common
Rule), these activities, which aim to protect the public’s health and improve
the quality of patient care, are considered health care “practice” rather than
health research.
HHS considered public health and quality improvement activities
important enough to give them special status under federal regulations by
permitting them to be undertaken without authorization or an IRB/Privacy
Board waiver of authorization. Yet it can be a challenge for IRBs and
Privacy Boards, researchers, health care practitioners, and research participants to distinguish among activities that are or are not subject to the
various provisions of the Privacy Rule (and the Common Rule). Inappro­
priate decisions may prevent important activities from being undertaken
or could potentially allow disclosures of PHI that are not permitted under
the regulations.
A number of models outlining the criteria IRBs and Privacy Boards
should use to distinguish practice and research have been proposed to
address these difficulties. One recent model, for example, provides a detailed
checklist for IRBs and Privacy Boards to use in determining whether an
activity is (1) public health “research” that must comply with the research
provisions of the Privacy Rule, or (2) public health “practice” that does not
need IRB or Privacy Board review.26
The committee believes that standardizing the criteria is essential to
support the conduct of these important health care activities. For that
reason, the committee recommends that HHS convene the relevant stake­
holders to develop standard criteria for IRBs and Privacy Boards to use
when making decisions about whether protocols entail research or prac26 See Chapter 3 for a complete discussion of this model.

tice, using the available models above as examples. The regulation should
have enough flexibility to allow important activities to go forward with
appropriate levels of oversight. In addition, it will be important to evaluate whether these criteria are effective in aiding IRB/Privacy Board reviews
of proposed protocols and whether they lead to appropriate IRB/Privacy
Board decisions.
Recommendation II.A.4: HHS guidance documents should simplify
the HIPAA Privacy Rule’s provisions regarding the use of PHI in activities preparatory to research and harmonize those provisions with the
Common Rule, in order to facilitate appropriate IRB and Privacy
Board oversight of identification and recruitment of potential research
participants.
Rationale
Many research studies, especially those focused on rare conditions with
limited eligible patient populations, rely on large-scale medical chart reviews
and searches of patient databases to identify patients who might be eligible
for and might benefit from a particular study. Sufficient patient enrollment
in a timely fashion is essential to ensure the meaningfulness and reliability of
the research results. Researchers may also need to examine medical records
in order to develop useful and appropriate research designs and protocols.
The HIPAA Privacy Rule has some specific provisions that allow a covered entity to use or disclose PHI without an individual’s authorization if
the information is to be used for research. One provision allows a covered
entity to use and disclose PHI without an individual’s authorization if the
covered entity obtains the following representations from the researcher:
(1) the use or disclosure of the information is solely to prepare a research
protocol or is otherwise preparatory to research; (2) the researcher will not
remove any PHI from the covered entity; and (3) the PHI for which access is
sought is necessary for the research.27 However, there is widespread confusion regarding what is permitted under this provision of the Privacy Rule.
Surveys and studies also indicate that recruiting patients for research has
become more difficult and costly under the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
HHS has issued multiple guidance statements to help address this confusion, but these guidance statements, some of which have been contradictory, have failed to solve the problem.
According to current HHS guidance on the Privacy Rule, researchers
(both internal and external to a covered entity) may conduct a review of
27 45 C.F.R. § 164.512(i)(1)(ii) (2006).

medical records under the Privacy Rule’s exception that allows the use and
disclosure of PHI without an individual’s authorization if the information is
being used by a researcher for activities preparatory to research. However,
HHS guidance also specifies that only internal researchers (an employee or
member of the covered entity’s workforce) may contact potential research
participants about the possibility of enrolling in a study under this provision of the Privacy Rule. External researchers are not allowed to record or
remove patient contact information from a covered entity. They must get
a partial waiver from an IRB or Privacy Board to perform any recruitment
activities. This interpretation of the Privacy Rule creates an artificial distinction between internal and external researchers that actually provides less
privacy protection than that afforded by the Common Rule, which requires
that any activities preparatory to research involving human subjects, or
related to initial recruitment of subjects for research studies, be reviewed
and approved by an IRB. Thus, the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits conduct
that is prohibited by the Common Rule.
According to SACHRP, HHS statements regarding these provisions for
activities preparatory to research have led to “enormous confusion,” and
many “institutions are hesitant to permit many recruitment activities critical
to the continuation of the research enterprise, out of fear that they are in
some way misinterpreting the government’s current positions on research
recruitment.” In 2004 SACHRP indicated that it was “very concerned that
the bureaucratic complexities here undermine, rather than enhance, the
attention that needs to be paid to the welfare and interests of subjects in
the research recruitment process.”
To address these issues, the committee recommends that all ­researchers
(including those internal to the covered entity) be required to obtain IRB
approval (as required under the Common Rule) prior to contacting potential
research participants. When making a decision about whether to approve
research projects, the IRB should review and consider the investigator’s
plans for contacting patients, and ensure that the information will be used
only for research projects approved by the IRB and will not be disclosed
elsewhere. The committee believes that IRBs can protect research participants, including their privacy and confidentiality interests, but as noted in
Recommendation II.A.1, educational outreach by HHS is needed to address
misunderstandings of these provisions.
Recommendation II.B: HHS should develop guidance materials to
facilitate effective use of existing data and materials for health research
and public health purposes.

BEYOND THE HIPAA PRIVACY RULE

Background
Many institutions create and maintain databases with patient health
information or repositories with biological materials collected from patients.
These databases and biospecimen banks are used for many types of health
research, including studies to understand diseases or to compare patient
outcomes following different treatments.
Current interpretations of provisions of the HIPAA Privacy Rule sometimes make it difficult to effectively use these valuable resources for health
research. Currently, for example, HHS interprets the Privacy Rule as prohibiting patient authorization for future research use of PHI associated with
the individuals’ biospecimens collected in the course of a clinical trial or
treatment by covered entities.
Such interpretations of the HIPAA Privacy Rule create confusion and
unnecessary burdens for patients and researchers alike and lead to lost
opportunity by impeding important health research. Furthermore, because
such interpretations are inconsistent with the Common Rule, they lead
to inequities between covered entities and non-covered entities that hold
databases and biospecimen banks.
The committee’s four specific recommendations below are intended to
facilitate important health research by maximizing the usefulness of patient
data associated with biospecimen banks and in research databases, thereby
allowing novel hypotheses to be tested with existing data and materials as
knowledge and technology improve. The recommendations would align
interpretation of the HIPAA Privacy Rule with the Common Rule on several
points, simplify or clarify the relevant processes in research, and develop
new tools for data aggregation.
Recommendation II.B.1: HHS should develop guidance that clearly
states that individuals can authorize use of PHI stored in databases or
associated with biospecimen banks for specified future research under
the HIPAA Privacy Rule with IRB oversight, as is allowed under the
Common Rule, to facilitate use of repositories for health research.
•
•

Future uses should be described in sufficient detail to allow individuals to give informed consent.
IRBs should determine that the new research is not incompatible
with the initial consent.

resource of information for rapidly addressing new health research ques-

tions as technologies and knowledge advance. Collecting the data and
biospecimens necessary to address each new research question as it arises
would take years, or even decades, at great expense. Thus, the pace and
efficiency of medical progress is enhanced significantly by using established
resources whenever feasible. When new potential prognostic markers of
disease are identified, for example, they must be validated by studying the
markers in many patients over the course of the disease. Examining samples
stored in biobanks, where disease progression has already been recorded
over many years, is a fast and relatively inexpensive way of determining
whether the marker has promise for clinical use and warrants further
investigation.
The provisions of the HIPAA Privacy Rule, as interpreted by HHS,
may impede research with established biospecimen banks and databases.
The Privacy Rule requires an individual’s authorization for the use or disclosure of protected information to describe, with specificity, the purpose
of the proposed use or disclosure of such information.28 HHS regards all
future uses of PHI as nonspecific—and therefore ineligible for inclusion in
an authorization for the collection and storage of biological materials and
data. In contrast, the Common Rule makes it possible to obtain individuals’
consent to future use or disclosure of their health information for health
research, with IRB oversight, as long as any intended future use is described
in sufficient detail to allow informed consent.
HHS has maintained that allowing individuals to authorize future uses
of their PHI could leave decisions about future research projects at the
discretion of covered entities, because the HIPAA Privacy Rule, unlike the
Common Rule, does not require IRB or Privacy Board review of research
uses and disclosures made with individual authorization.29 For that reason,
HHS requires that individuals be recontacted to obtain their authorization for the use or disclosure of their existing data and biospecimens for
any additional research studies undertaken unless the researchers obtain a
waiver or alteration of individual authorization. Recontacting individuals
to obtain their additional authorization is very impractical. Even when
another contact is possible, the process can be intrusive and burdensome
for patients and their families.
As long as an IRB is overseeing the research, obtaining individuals’
authorization for future use of their information in existing databases and
biospecimen banks in health research should be adequate for protecting
privacy. One way to overcome the discordance between the Privacy Rule
and the Common Rule would be for HHS to issue guidance explicitly stating that future research may go forward if the following conditions are

met: (1) the individual’s authorization describes the types or categories of
research that may be conducted with the PHI stored in the database or
biobank; and (2) an IRB determines that the proposed new research is not
incompatible with the initial consent and authorization, and poses no more
than a minimal risk.
Because science is evolving quickly, one cannot adequately anticipate
what knowledge will be gained in the future. Significant opportunities
for beneficial research could be lost without some revisions in the current
interpretation of this portion of the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Databases and
biospecimen banks created and maintained with federal funds, in particular,
should be used for multiple studies as often as feasible, especially given the
high cost of developing such repositories and the high value of investigating
and comparing multiple scientific questions from the same pool of data.
Recommendation II.B.2: HHS should develop clear guidance for use of
a single form that permits individuals to authorize use and disclosure
of health information in a clinical trial and to authorize the storage of
their biospecimens collected in conjunction with the clinical trial, in
order to simplify authorization for interrelated research activities.
Rationale
Informed consent and authorization are essential for the protection of
individuals who volunteer to participate in clinical trials. Thus, it is imperative that the informed consent and authorization documents are easily
understood and meaningful to the individuals involved. Ideally, all relevant
information should be integrated into one simple document.
The HIPAA Privacy Rule’s complex provisions have generated mis­
perceptions about restrictions on individuals’ ability to provide compound
authorization for the related activities of clinical trial participation and
biospecimen donation. Such misperceptions can diminish the informed
nature of consent and authorization because they can lead to patient
confusion and misunderstanding. HHS has stated that if a covered entity
plans to collect and store biospecimens in a research repository in conjunction with a clinical trial, individuals’ authorization for storage of the PHI
associated with the repository must be separate from authorization for
disclosure of the PHI associated with participation in the clinical trial.
HHS arrived at this interpretation through a series of steps. First,
it is generally not permissible to condition treatment on an individual’s
authorization for the use of PHI, although the HIPAA Privacy Rule does
permit a covered entity to condition treatment in a clinical trial on sign-

ing an authorization.30 Second, although the HIPAA Privacy Rule generally permits researchers to combine an authorization form with any other
type of written permission (including another authorization), it prohibits
­researchers from combining authorizations where the covered entity conditions the provision of treatment on signing only one of the authorizations,
but not the other.31 Because HHS has concluded that collection of PHI for a
clinical trial and for a repository are separate research activities, researchers
cannot condition participation in the clinical trial on signing authorization
to include PHI in a repository.32
Currently, therefore, the two authorizations cannot be combined in one
form unless (1) the form has separate signature lines for each authorization, and (2) the text clearly delineates the two activities and states that the
participant is not required to sign the portion authorizing the contribution
of PHI to the repository in order to receive treatment in a clinical trial.
There is much confusion about these provisions of the HIPAA Privacy
Rule, and some institutions require two complete authorization forms with
all the attendant language rather than two signature lines on the same form.
The excess paperwork that results is burdensome for patients; can reduce
the informed nature of authorization by confusing patients; and may reduce
patient participation in research. Guidance from HHS to clearly indicate
that a single authorization form with two signature lines is permissible in
such circumstances would reduce variability and increase the informed
nature of authorization.
Recommendation II.B.3: HHS should clarify the circumstances under
which DNA samples or sequences are considered PHI, in order to
facilitate appropriate use of DNA in health research.
Rationale
With recent technological advances in biomedical research, it is now
possible to learn a great deal about disease processes and individual variations in treatment effectiveness or susceptibility to disease from genetic
analyses because the DNA sequences that make up a person’s genome
strongly influence a person’s health. In this genomic age of health research,
patient blood and tissue samples stored in biospecimen banks can provide a

wealth of information for addressing long-standing questions about health
and disease.
But HHS has not yet issued clear guidance on how the HIPAA Privacy
Rule applies to DNA samples or sequences. HHS guidance documents
indicate that blood or tissue samples themselves are not protected under
HIPAA unless they contain or are associated with the 18 personal identifiers
specified by the HIPAA Privacy Rule. In addition, HHS has stated that the
results of an analysis of blood or tissue, if containing or associated with
individually identifiable information, would be PHI. Yet the research community remains uncertain about whether genetic information accompanying biospecimens is protected under the HIPAA Privacy Rule because the list
of HIPAA identifiers includes vague terms such as “biometric identifiers”
and “unique identifying characteristics.”33
Genetic information does not itself identify an individual in the absence
of other identifying information. Even the European Union, which has a
more restrictive privacy regime than the United States, does not consider
DNA in and of itself to be a direct identifier.34 In some circumstances,
however, a person’s genetic code could be construed as a unique identifier
in that it could be used to match sequence in another biospecimen bank
or databank that does include identifiers. As genetic information becomes
more prevalent in research and health care, the latter scenario is more
likely to occur. As health care enters the era of personalized medicine, for
example, genetic information is more likely to be included in a person’s
health records. But at the same time, realization of the promises of personalized medicine will require research on DNA from a great many diverse
individuals whose medical history is well documented.
The committee believes that establishing consistent standards for the
use and protection of genetic information is important. The committee
advocates a focus on strong security measures and recommends the adoption of strict prohibitions on the unauthorized reidentification of indi­viduals
from DNA sequences, by anyone.
Regardless of how genetic information is regulated under the HIPAA
Privacy Rule, a federal prohibition of genetic discrimination is necessary
to allay privacy concerns and diminish potential negative consequences of
unintended disclosure of genetic information. Many people are concerned
about genetic discrimination—the misuse of genetic information by insurance companies, employers, and others to make decisions based on a
person’s DNA. Thus, in addition to protecting the privacy of individuals’

genetic information, it is important to protect people against genetic discrimination. The hope is that the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination
Act of 2008, recently signed into law, will begin to address some of these
concerns.
Recommendation II.B.4: HHS should develop a mechanism for linking
data from multiple sources so that more useful datasets can be made
available for research in a manner that protects privacy, confidentiality,
and security.
Rationale
Because a single database may not provide a complete picture of a
patient’s condition or health history, it is often necessary to combine information about a patient from multiple sources. However, the way in which
the HIPAA Privacy Rule has been interpreted and implemented has made
linking data from diverse sources for research purposes more difficult.
Thus, the Privacy Rule impedes health research and compromises the value
and reliability of research that is undertaken.
Under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, it is possible in principle for a researcher
to aggregate PHI from multiple covered entities with individual authorization or with an IRB or Privacy Board’s waiver of such authorization.
Obtaining individuals’ authorization for research that entails the review of
thousands of medical records is unrealistic, though, and even with a waiver
of authorization, covered entities with large datasets are now often reluctant to allow researchers access to PHI. More commonly, covered entities
provide data to researchers with direct identifiers removed. Because datasets
from multiple sources cannot be linked to generate a more complete record
of a patient’s health history without a unique identifier, though, datasets
with direct identifiers removed are often of minimal value to researchers
and are not frequently used. A third party may collect PHI from covered
entities and aggregate the data for research by establishing business associate agreements with the various data sources, but in practice, such agreements are used infrequently for this purpose because they are complicated
and impractical to set up for individual research projects.
The committee believes a better approach would be to establish secure,
trusted intermediaries that could develop a protocol, or key, for routinely
linking health data from different sources, and then provide more complete
and useful datasets with the identifiers removed to researchers. One way
this could be accomplished, for example, might be through data warehouses that are certified for the purpose of linking data from different
sources. The organizations responsible for such linking would be required
to use strong security measures and would maintain the details about how

BEYOND THE HIPAA PRIVACY RULE

the linkage was done, should another research team need to recreate the
linked dataset. Using such intermediaries would facilitate greater use of
health data with direct identifiers removed for research and lead to more
meaningful study results while also increasing patient privacy protections
and allaying concerns of covered entities.
Some federal agencies are already developing mechanisms for linking
information from different sources. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
Services (CMS), for example, provides a linking service for Medicare and
Medicaid data via contractors that create standardized data files tailored for
research. CMS also has begun pilot projects to aggregate Medicare claims
data with data from commercial health plans and, in some cases, Medicaid,
in order to calculate and report quality measures for physician groups.
A broader effort to link data from diverse sources, called the National
Health Data Stewardship Entity, has been initiated by the federal Agency
for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). AHRQ is also involved in
implementing the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005,
which encourages creation of Patient Safety Organizations to receive information from hospitals, doctors, and health care providers on a privileged
and confidential basis, for analysis and aggregation. Even though the purpose of these two AHRQ initiatives is to monitor health care quality,35,36
they could provide a model for data aggregation that is potentially applicable to health research.
The administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA specifically provided for the creation of a unique individual identifier that would permit
the linking of data from different sources, but work on developing such
an identifier has been halted because there is a great deal of controversy
regarding how it could be implemented without compromising individual
privacy. In addition, federal agencies are under pressure from the Office of
Budget and Management to reduce the use of Social Security numbers as
unique identifiers. Nevertheless, it is clear that the development of some
type of linking key (not based on Social Security numbers) would make
linkages among databases more efficient, standardized, and reliable, and
less costly. Moreover, this type of linkage could greatly facilitate many types
of information research and improve quality of care.

research without providing substantive improvements in patient
privacy.
Background
For some provisions of the HIPAA Privacy Rule, the burdens are heavy
and the privacy protections are small. Such provisions may need to be
reconsidered if society is to derive maximal benefits from health research.
The committee recommends revising two components of the HIPAA Privacy
Rule that are very burdensome with respect to the level of privacy protection they afford.
Recommendation II.C.1: HHS should reform the requirements for the
accounting of disclosures (AOD) of PHI for research.
•

The HIPAA Privacy Rule should permit covered entities to inform
patients in advance that PHI might be used for health research
with IRB/Privacy Board oversight or for public health purposes.
Accordingly, the Privacy Rule should be revised to exempt disclosures of PHI made for research and public health purposes from
the Privacy Rule’s accounting of disclosures requirements. As an
alternative to AOD, to ensure transparency, institutions should
maintain a list, accessible to the public, of all studies approved by
an IRB/Privacy Board.

Rationale
Under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, individuals have a right to receive an
accounting of disclosures, a list of all disclosures of their PHI by a covered
entity or the covered entity’s business associates in the past 6 years. According to HHS, the AOD provision of the HIPAA Privacy Rule was intended
“as a means for the individual to find out the nonroutine purposes for
which his or her PHI was disclosed by the covered entity, so as to increase
the individual’s awareness of persons or entities other than the individual’s
health care provider or health plan in possession of this information.” The
AOD requirement does not constitute an audit trail, though, because the
provision has numerous exceptions—including disclosures of PHI for health
care operations, pursuant to an authorization, as part of a limited dataset,
for national security or intelligence purposes, and to correctional institutions or law enforcement officials.
Disclosures of PHI by covered entities for research purposes under
a waiver of individual authorization approved by an IRB or a Privacy
Board, or for public health purposes as required by law, must be included

52

BEYOND THE HIPAA PRIVACY RULE

in an AOD report. Furthermore, HHS has noted that “making a set of
records available for review by a third party constitutes a disclosure
of the PHI in the entire set of records, regardless of whether the third
party actually reviews any particular record.” The AOD provision of the
HIPAA Privacy Rule provides an exception for research involving groups
of 50 or more subjects by allowing the covered entity to develop a general
list of all protocols for which a person’s PHI may have been disclosed.
Even then, however, there is a considerable administrative obligation to
generate such a list. Furthermore, in many medical facilities, a general list
of protocols is extensive and thus relatively meaningless to a particular
patient.
The AOD provision of the HIPAA Privacy Rule places a heavy administrative burden on health systems and health services research that achieves
little in terms of protecting privacy. Moreover, HHS has provided no guidance to covered entities about practical ways to fulfill this requirement in an
efficient manner. On the basis of testimony in 2004, the Secretary’s Advisory
Committee on Human Research Protections concluded that the cost and
burden of compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule’s AOD requirements
were so high that institutions were likely to accept the risk of noncompliance
rather than incur the cost of compliance.
Annual surveys of health care privacy officers undertaken by the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA) since 2004
have similarly found that many facilities report difficulties with the AOD
requirement. Such surveys have also found that the demand for AOD reports
by individuals is extremely low. Two thirds of health care privacy officers
participating in the survey reported receiving no requests at all. Nearly one
third of respondents indicated that they would like to see a change to the
AOD provision of the HIPAA Privacy Rule—the most frequently cited provision among all respondents and the most frequently cited provision by far
among respondents with more than 20,000 admissions/­discharges per year.
On the basis of these results, AHIMA concluded that “for many, this [AOD]
provision is not only burdensome but also significantly inefficient.”37
Robust safeguards are already in place to protect the privacy of PHI
disclosures in health research via IRBs and Privacy Boards. As the health
care system moves toward broader implementation of electronic health
records, however, automatic tracking of audit trails will be important to
incorporate. Technology advances will likely make automatic AOD tracking feasible, affordable, and widely available in the future. Until then, the
committee recommends that disclosures of PHI made for health research

and public health purposes be exempted from the HIPAA Privacy Rule’s
AOD requirement.
Recommendation II.C.2: HHS should simplify the criteria that IRBs
and Privacy Boards use in making determinations for when they can
waive the requirements to obtain authorization from each patient whose
PHI will be used for a research study, in order to facilitate appropriate
authorization requirements for responsible research.
•

If HHS decides to retain the current waiver criteria, HHS should
provide clear and reasonable definitions of terms used in those
criteria, such as “minimal risk” to the privacy of individuals (in
the first criterion) and “impracticable” (in the second and third
criteria). HHS should also provide specific case examples of what
should or should not be considered impracticable or of minimal
risk.

Rationale
Under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, researchers seeking to use PHI in
medical records for research must obtain authorization from each patient
unless an IRB or a Privacy Board makes a determination that a waiver of
individual authorization is warranted. For many types of research with
medical records, making that determination is a challenge for IRBs and
Privacy Boards. Many studies involve thousands of records, making individual authorization unrealistic. But the criteria in the HIPAA Privacy Rule
that IRBs and Privacy Boards apply in making these decisions are complex
and very subjective.
Currently, IRBs and Privacy Boards must use three criteria in considering whether to approve a waiver of individual authorization for the use of
PHI in research.38 The first criterion is that the use or disclosure of PHI
in the research involves no more than a “minimal risk” to the privacy of
individuals. The Privacy Rule lists three elements that must be present in
making this determination: (1) “an adequate plan to protect the identifiers
from improper use and disclosure;” (2) “an adequate plan to destroy the
identifiers;” and (3) “adequate written assurances that the PHI will not be
reused or disclosed to any other person or entity, except as required by law,
for authorized oversight of the research project, or for other research for
which the use or disclosure of PHI is otherwise permissible.” However, the
decision about what is “adequate” is highly subjective, and thus different
institutions are likely to set varying thresholds for “minimal risk.”

54

BEYOND THE HIPAA PRIVACY RULE

The other two criteria that IRBs or Privacy Boards currently must use
in considering whether to approve a waiver of individual authorization
are (1) that “the research could not practicably be conducted without the
waiver;” and (2) that the “research could not practicably be conducted
without access to and use of PHI”39 (as opposed to deidentified data or a
limited dataset). The concept of practicability is used in both the Common
Rule and in the HIPAA authorization criteria, but what is “practicable” or
“impracticable” has never been adequately defined by the HHS Office for
Human Research Protections or the HHS Office for Civil Rights (e.g., with
regard to cost/feasibility). Not surprisingly, therefore, institutions apply
varying definitions independently, often too conservatively to allow even
low-risk research to proceed. Some institutions interpret the term impracticable to mean not at all possible and even require researchers to demonstrate that a study will fail without a waiver of authorization. The lack of
clarity leads to a great deal of variability across institutions and impedes
research. Patients have also questioned the meaning of the term.
Simplification or clarification by HHS of the criteria that IRBs or Privacy Boards must use in deciding whether to approve a waiver of individual
authorization would be especially helpful for multi-institutional studies,
which fall under the jurisdiction of multiple IRBs or Privacy Boards. Covered entities are permitted to rely on a waiver of authorization approved
by a single IRB or Privacy Board with jurisdiction. Currently, however,
covered entities often decide to require approval from their own IRB or
Privacy Board prior to disclosing PHI to the requesting researcher, regardless of whether another IRB or Privacy Board already granted a waiver of
authorization. This practice leads to delays and variability in the protocol
at different sites.
Simplification of the criteria for approval of waivers by IRBs and Privacy Boards would also be helpful for smaller or community-based institutions that do not have internal counsel or regulatory affairs specialists, and
thus are more likely to opt out of research that requires decisions about
authorizations. With better guidance, all covered entities would have more
confidence in their decisions and might be more willing to rely on a lead
IRB or Privacy Board’s decision in the case of multi-institutional studies.
If HHS decides to retain the three criteria that IRBs or Privacy Boards
currently use in deciding whether to approve a waiver of individual authorization, however, the committee recommends that HHS provide clear and
reasonable definitions of the vague terms used in those criteria. Specifically,
HHS should define what constitutes “minimal risk” to the privacy of individuals (in the first criterion) and define what constitutes “impracticable”
(in the second and third criteria). HHS should also provide specific case

examples of what should or should not be considered impracticable or of
minimal risk to reduce variability and overly conservative interpretations.
III. Implement Changes Necessary for Both Policy Options Above
(Recommendations I and II)
Regardless of whether Recommendation I or II is implemented, the
following recommendations, which are independent of the Privacy Rule,
should be adopted. Strong security measures are essential to effective privacy protection, willingness to serve in IRBs is important for ensuring
appropriate oversight of research, and the public should be provided with
more information about health research.
Recommendation III.A: All institutions (both covered entities and noncovered entities) in the health research community that are involved
in the collection, use, and disclosure of personally identifiable health
information should take strong measures to safeguard the security of
health data. For example, institutions could:
•
•
•
•
•

Appoint a security officer responsible for assessing data protection
needs and implementing solutions and staff training.
Make greater use of encryption and other techniques for data
security.
Include data security experts on IRBs.
Implement a breach notification requirement, so that patients may
take steps to protect their identity in the event of a breach.
Implement layers of security protection to eliminate single points
of vulnerability to security breaches.

In addition, the federal government should support the development
and use of:
•
•

Genuine privacy-enhancing techniques that minimize or eliminate
the collection of personally identifiable data.
Standardized self-evaluations and security audits and certification
programs to help institutions achieve the goal of safeguarding the
security of personal health data.

Rationale
Effective health privacy protections require effective data security
measures. Protecting the privacy of research participants and maintaining the confidentiality of their data have always been imperative to most

r­ esearchers and a fundamental tenet of clinical research. Recently, however,
several highly publicized examples of stolen or misplaced computers containing health data have heightened the public’s concerns about privacy.
Such events pose problems not only for patient privacy, but also for health
research, because public trust is essential for patients to be willing to participate in research. Moreover, data security is a key component of comprehensive privacy protections. Thus, the committee recommends improving
the security of personally identifiable health information.
The HIPAA Security Rule (which entails a set of regulatory provisions
separate from the Privacy Rule) already sets a floor for data security standards within covered entities, but not all institutions that conduct health
research are subject to HIPAA regulations. Moreover, the security protections intended by the HIPAA Security Rule may not be sufficient to prevent
breaches.
The committee recommends that all institutions conducting health
research undertake measures to strengthen data protections. Given the
recent spate of lost or stolen laptops containing patient health information,
for example, encryption should be required for all laptops and removable
media containing such data. There are differences among the missions and
activities of institutions in the health research community, however, so
some flexibility in the implementation of specific security measures will be
necessary.
Examples of security standards and guidelines already exist in some
sectors, but they are not widely applied in academic settings. The National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), for example, has developed
standards and guidance for the implementation of the Federal Information
Security Management Act of 2002, which was meant to bolster computer
and network security within the federal government and affiliated parties (e.g., government contractors). The NIST standards include minimum
security requirements for information and information systems, as well
as guidance for assessing and selecting appropriate security controls for
information systems, for determining security control effectiveness, and for
certifying and accrediting information systems.40
HHS, working through its Office of the National Coordinator for
Health Information Technology,41 could play an important role in developing or adapting standards for health research applications, then encourage
and facilitate broader use of such standards in the health research commu40 National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Federal Information Security

nity. The issue of the security of health data will continue to grow in importance as the health care industry moves toward widespread implementation
of electronic health records, and Congress has already proposed numerous
bills to facilitate and regulate that transition. As noted in the committee’s
recommendation about the requirements for the accounting of disclosures
of PHI for research above (Recommendation II.C.1), advances in information technology will likely make it easier to implement measures such as
audit trails and access controls in the future.
Enhancing security could reduce the risk of data theft and reinforce
the public’s trust in the research community by diminishing anxiety about
the potential for unintentional disclosure of information. The publication
of best practices and outreach to all stakeholders by HHS, combined with
a cooperative approach to compliance with security standards such as selfevaluation and audit programs, would promote progress in this area. As
noted in Recommendation II.A.1, research sponsors could also play a role
in fostering the adoption of best practices in data security.
Recommendation III.B: HHS—or, as necessary, Congress—should
provide reasonable protection against civil suits brought pursuant to
federal or state law for members of IRBs and Privacy Boards for decisions made within the scope of their responsibilities under the HIPAA
Privacy Rule and the Common Rule, in order to encourage service on
Institutional Review Boards and Privacy Boards. The limitation on
liability for members of IRBs and Privacy Boards should not include
protection for willful and wanton misconduct in reviewing the research,
but should instead be reserved for good-faith decisions, backed by minutes or other evidence, in responsibly applying the legal requirements
under the HIPAA Privacy Rule or the Common Rule.
Rationale
IRBs, Privacy Boards, and institutions have enormous responsibility in
determining whether health research projects are planned and conducted
in a way that minimizes or eliminates the potential risk to human research
participants, including both direct physical harms and nonphysical harms
(e.g., breach of privacy). The workload of IRBs and the complexity of their
work have been steadily increasing as a result of new and evolving requirements for research regulation and documentation, including the HIPAA
Privacy Rule. Surveys and studies indicate that the IRB review process has
become more lengthy and difficult since implementation of the Privacy
Rule, which may increase opportunity costs due to delayed or undiscovered
research findings that might improve health.
Effective oversight of health research depends on the recruitment of

58

BEYOND THE HIPAA PRIVACY RULE

qualified and knowledgeable volunteers to serve on IRBs and Privacy Boards.
But the increasing workload and complexity of IRB and Privacy Board service
have made it difficult to recruit and retain knowledgeable IRB and Privacy
Board members and to ensure time for the ethical reflection necessary to make
appropriate decisions about human research projects. Moreover, because of
the growth over the past decade of lawsuits naming individual IRB members
as defendants, fear of penalties and civil suits can be a significant deterrent
in recruiting qualified volunteers to serve on IRBs and Privacy Boards. Such
fears could also lead IRB and Privacy Board members to be overly conservative in their decisions about research proposals brought before them.
Members of IRBs and Privacy Boards are generally indemnified by
their institutions, but they are not immune from being named in a suit.
Therefore, they might still have to devote time and resources to defending
themselves for decisions made by an IRB or Privacy Board on which they
served. Members of IRBs or Privacy Boards who receive limited protection
against lawsuits may be less likely to interpret the HIPAA Privacy Rule too
conservatively.
Providing this type of limitation on liability for IRB and Privacy Board
members would be similar to the precedent of protection for peer review
members under state laws and under the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986. A similar provision was incorporated into the Ontario
Personal Health Information Protection Act of 2004, under which members
of ethical boards are immune for acts done and omissions made in good
faith that are reasonable under the circumstances. In addition to reducing
over interpretation of the HIPAA Privacy Rule in health research, such
protections might also facilitate multi-institutional research by reducing the
variability among local IRBs and Privacy Boards, as they should be more
willing to accept the decision of a lead IRB or Privacy Board. Indeed, moving in the direction of national IRBs/Privacy Boards, as is encouraged by
the National Cancer Institute for cancer clinical trials, might further reduce
overly conservative interpretation of the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
Finally, it should be noted that HHS policy is to seek compliance
with the HIPAA Privacy Rule first, rather than penalties, when a concern
is brought to its attention. Institutions might be less inclined to interpret
the HIPAA Privacy Rule too conservatively if this policy were stated more
clearly in guidance materials provided by HHS. Thus, even without the
enactment of a new protective statute for IRB and Privacy Board members,
simple clarification and clear communication of the way HHS will enforce
the HIPAA Privacy Rule and seek penalties would be helpful.
Recommendation III.C: HHS and researchers should take steps to provide the public with more information about health research.

OVERVIEW OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

59

Background
Surveys indicate that the vast majority of Americans believe health
research is important, and are interested in the findings of research studies.
The majority of patients also appear to be willing to participate in health
research, either by volunteering for a study to test a medical intervention
or by allowing access to their medical records or stored biospecimens,
under certain conditions. Their willingness to participate in research is
dependent on trust in researchers to safeguard the rights and well-being of
patients, including assurance of privacy and confidentiality, and the belief
that the research is a worthwhile endeavor that warrants their involvement. Yet patients often lack information about how health research is
conducted and are rarely informed about research results that may have a
direct impact on their health. The committee’s two recommendations below
address the public’s desire for more information about health research and
are important components in fulfilling two of the committee’s overarching
goals of the report: (1) improving the privacy and data security of health
information, and (2) improving the effectiveness of health research. Both
recommendations could be accomplished by HHS and the health research
community without any changes to HIPAA or the Privacy Rule by making
them a condition of funding from HHS and other research sponsors and
by providing additional funds to cover the cost.
Recommendation III.C.1: Health researchers should make greater
efforts to inform study participants and the public about the results of
research and the relevance and importance of those results.
•
•

Researchers should inform interested research participants (who
granted authorization for a particular study) with a simplified summary of the results at the conclusion of a research study.
HHS should encourage registration of trials and other studies in
public databases, particularly when research is conducted with a
waiver of authorization.

Rationale
Empirical evidence indicates that people want to be informed about
research results, and ethicists have long recommended this kind of feedback
and community involvement. In addition, the IOM committee identified
transparency—the responsibility to disclose clearly how and why personally
identifiable information is being collected—as an important component of
comprehensive privacy protections. An IOM report in 2002 titled Responsible Research: A Systems Approach to Protecting Research Participants

BEYOND THE HIPAA PRIVACY RULE

recommended improved communication with the public and research participants to ensure that the protection process is open and accessible to all
interested parties, noting that transparency is best achieved by providing
graded levels of information and guidance to interested parties.
Effective communication could also build the public’s trust in the
research community, which is important because trust is necessary for the
public’s continued participation in research under both the HIPAA Privacy
Rule and the committee’s new framework. Learning about clinically relevant findings from a study in which a patient has participated could make
patients feel more integrated into the process and could encourage more
patients to participate in future studies. Moreover, if the study results indicate that an altered course of care is warranted, direct feedback about these
results could lead to improved health care for study participants.
Thus, the committee recommends that when patients grant authorization for their medical records to be used in a particular study, health
researchers should make greater efforts at the conclusion of the study to
inform study participants about the results, and the relevance and importance of those results. Broader adoption of electronic medical records may
be helpful in accomplishing this goal, but multiple impediments, beyond
cost and technology, may prevent delivery of meaningful feedback to participants. Although some guidelines for providing and explaining study
results to research participants have been proposed, they differ in details
because limited data are available on this subject, and thus standards are
lacking. A summary of the results alone, while necessary and reasonable,
can be seen as a token, and also raises questions about issues such as how
best to write summaries and how to present research with uninformative
outcomes.
HHS should also encourage registration of trials and other studies in
public databases, particularly when research is conducted with a waiver
of authorization as a way to make information about research studies
more broadly available to the public. Numerous clinical trial registries
already exist, and registration has increased in recent years. The National
Library of Medicine established a clinical trials registry42 in 2000, which
has expanded to serve as the FDA’s required site for submissions about clinical trials subject to the FDA databank requirement and now also includes
information from several other trial registries. The FDA Amendments Act
of 2007 expanded the scope of required registrations and provided the first
federally funded trials results database. In fall 2005, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors adopted a policy requiring prospective
trial registration as a precondition for publication.
The development of clinical trial registries is an important first step
toward providing high-quality clinical trial information to the public. Cur42 See http://clinicaltrials.gov (accessed August 6, 2008).

rently, however, there is no centralized system for disseminating information about clinical trials of drugs or other interventions. Thus, patients
and their health care providers have difficulty identifying ongoing studies.
Moreover, some trials are still exempt from registration and data reporting.
An additional limitation of clinical trial databases is that noninterventional
studies (including observational studies that play an increasingly critical
role in biomedical research) are not generally included. Because many noninterventional studies are conducted with a waiver of authorization, including those studies in a registry could be an important method for increasing
public knowledge of those studies.
Recommendation III.C.2: HHS and the health research community
should work to educate the public about how health research is done,
and what value it provides.
Rationale
Health research provides a community benefit by determining the most
effective treatments and by developing new therapies. Interventional clinical trials are the most visible of the various types of health research, but a
great deal of informative health research entails analysis of thousands of
patient records to better understand human diseases, to determine treatment effectiveness, and to identify adverse side effects of therapies. This
form of research is likely to increase in frequency as the availability of electronic health records continues to expand. As medicine moves toward the
goal of personalized medicine, research results will be even more likely to
be directly relevant to patients, but more study participants will be needed
to derive meaningful results.
However, many patients probably are not aware that their medical
records are being used in database research. Moreover, surveys show that
many patients desire not only notice, but also the opportunity to decide
about whether to consent to such research with medical records. As noted
in Recommendation III.A, strengthening security protections of health data
should reduce the risk of security breaches and their potential negative consequences, and thus should help to alleviate patient concerns in this regard.
But educating patients about how health research is conducted, monitored,
and reported could also help to increase patients trust in the research community, which is important for the public’s continued participation under
both the HIPAA Privacy Rule and the committee’s new framework.
In addition, an educated public could also decrease the potential for
biased research samples. A universal requirement to obtain authorization
for medical records research can lead to a biased study sample, and thus
inaccurate conclusions, because those who decline to participate may be
more or less likely than average to have a particular health problem. A

BEYOND THE HIPAA PRIVACY RULE

study sample may also be biased if certain members are underrepresented
or overrepresented relative to others in the population. A biased sample
is problematic, because any statistic computed from that sample has the
potential to be consistently erroneous, and thus, conclusions drawn from a
biased sample are likely to be invalid. Conveying to the public the importance of health care improvements derived from medical records research
and stressing the negative impact of incomplete datasets on research findings may increase the public’s participation in research and their willingness to support information-based research that is conducted with IRB or
Privacy Board oversight and a waiver of patient authorization.
There are numerous examples of important research findings from
medical records research that would not have been possible if direct patient
consent and authorization were always required, including the finding that
infants exposed to diethylstilbestrol (DES) during the first trimester of
pregnancy had an increased risk of breast, vaginal, and cervical cancer and
reproductive anomalies as adults. Studies of medical records also led to the
discovery that folic acid supplementation during pregnancy can prevent
neural tube defects.
Thus, HHS and the health research community should work to educate the public about how research is done, and what value it provides. All
stakeholders, including professional organizations, nonprofit funders, and
patient organizations, have different interests and responsibilities to make
sure their constituencies are well informed, but coordination and identification of best practices by HHS would be helpful. For example, the American
Society of Clinical Oncology and the American Heart Association already
have some online resources to help patients gather information about
research that may be relevant to their conditions. Research is needed to
identify which segments of the population would be receptive to and benefit
from various types of information about how research is done and its value
in order to create and implement an effective education plan.
Greater use of community-based participatory research, in which
­community-based organizations or groups bring community members into
the research process as partners to help design studies and disseminate the
knowledge gained,43 would also help achieve this goal. These groups help
researchers to design activities that the community is likely to value and to
recruit research participants, by using the knowledge of the community to
understand health problems. They also inform community members about
how the research is done and what comes out of it, with the goal of providing immediate community benefits from the results when possible.

Introduction

Brief History of HIPAA and the Privacy Rule
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) was
passed on August 21, 1996, with the dual goals of making health care
delivery more efficient and increasing the number of Americans with health
insurance coverage. These objectives were pursued through three main provisions of the Act: (1) the portability provisions, (2) the tax provisions, and
(3) the administrative simplification provisions. The focus of this report,
the HIPAA Privacy Rule, was promulgated under the third provision. The
administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA instructed the Secretary
of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to issue several regulations concerning electronic transmission of health information,
which was expanding greatly in the early 1990s. The primary purpose of
these provisions was to standardize the use of electronic health information, but Congress also recognized that advances in electronic technology
could endanger the privacy of health information. Thus, HIPAA mandated
the development of nationwide security standards and safeguards for the
use of electronic health care information as well as the creation of privacy
standards for protected health information.
 Protected health information is personally identifiable health information transmitted by

electronic media, maintained in electronic media, or transmitted or maintained in any other
form or medium. Protected health information excludes education records covered by the
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, as amended, 20 U.S.C. 1232(g), records described
at 20 U.S.C. 1232(g)(a)(4)(B)(iv), and employment records held by a covered entity in its role
as employer.

BEYOND THE HIPAA PRIVACY RULE

Although the Common Rule imposed some requirements on the use
of health information in research, federal regulations specifically targeting
health information privacy were lacking. In accordance with the administrative simplification provisions, HHS developed the HIPAA Privacy Rule,
which set out detailed regulations regarding the types of uses and disclosures of personally identifiable health information that are permitted by the
covered entities. HHS first issued a proposed version of the HIPAA Privacy
Rule for public comment in 1999, but because of the enormous volume of
comments received regarding the regulations, as well as a change in executive branch leadership following the 2000 Presidential election, the HIPAA
Privacy Rule evolved through several iterations before the final version was
issued in 2002 (45 C.F.R. parts 160 and 164). Most health care providers
and health plans were required to be in compliance with this version of the
HIPAA Privacy Rule by April 14, 2003. Small health plans were given until
April 14, 2004, to be in compliance.
The primary targets of the HIPAA Privacy Rule were information uses
and transactions necessary for the provision of health care, but the final
regulations also apply to a great deal of health research. Congress recognized the important role that health records play in conducting health
research, and wanted to ensure that implementation of the HIPAA Privacy
Rule would not impede researchers’ continued access to such data. This
is reflected in two House reports on HIPAA with identical language, stating: “The conferees recognize that certain uses of individually identifiable
information are appropriate, and do not compromise the privacy of an
individual. Examples of such use of information include . . . the transfer
of information from a health plan to an organization for the sole purpose
of conducting health care–related research. As health plans and providers
continue to focus on outcomes research and innovation, it is important
that the exchange and aggregated use of health care data be allowed” (U.S.
Congress, 1996a,b).
In response, HHS attempted to create a system that mandated privacy
protection for individually identifiable health information while allowing important uses of the information in health care and research. Thus,
researchers must now follow the provisions of the HIPAA Privacy Rule
when obtaining data from a covered entity.

 The “Common Rule” is the term used by 18 federal agencies who have adopted the same
regulations governing the protection of human subjects of research.
 45 C.F.R. § 160.103 (2006), a health plan, a health care clearinghouse, or a health care
provider that transmits health information in electronic form in connection with a transaction
for which HHS has adopted a standard.

INTRODUCTION

Privacy and Health Research
Health research and privacy protections both provide valuable benefits
to society, and the two topics are interrelated. Researchers know that trust
is essential for patients to be willing to participate in research, and many
patients value research and are willing to share their health information in
the hope of reaping some benefit from scientific advances for themselves or
their families. Collection and analysis of health information is necessary to
attain the full benefits of health research for the individual, the family, and
the community. The challenge is to identify the most essential components
of both privacy protection and research, to ensure maximal benefit and
minimal risk.
Some health research projects with important implications for health
care improvements and public health protections entail the analysis of information that many would consider sensitive. For example, some research
examines information regarding individuals’ sexuality, or smoking, alcohol,
and drug use habits. Also, it may be necessary to collect information on an
individual’s social, racial, or economic status to study the influence of poverty, nutrition, and social relationships on health. Many research projects
now also study a person’s genetic profile to gain insight into predispositions
for diseases. Epidemiology and public health research may trace disease
incidence and characteristics, or response to treatments.
Research participants are more willing to share personal information
and more likely to truthfully answer research questions when they believe
the privacy of their personal information is protected against inadvertent
or unwanted disclosure. This helps to assure individuals that their risk of
harm in participating, including economic, social, or psychological harm, is
minimal (Hodge et al., 1999). Furthermore, when researchers have access
to accurate and comprehensive medical datasets, the results are more likely
to be valid and meaningful to broad populations.
Privacy Concerns
Since the HIPAA Privacy Rule was implemented, privacy advocates and
others have argued that the United States needs stronger privacy protections
than are provided in the HIPAA Privacy Rule (Friedman, 2006; Gellman,
2006; Sobel, 2007). These demands have generally focused on health care
rather than health research, and are based to a large extent on theory, opinions, and anecdotal experiences. As noted in the methods section below, a
Harris Poll undertaken during the course of this study provided new and
current insight into the experiences and expectations of the U.S. public with
regard to privacy in health research. A review of the relevant literature,
including surveys and focus group studies, can be found in Chapter 2.

BEYOND THE HIPAA PRIVACY RULE

After reviewing the available evidence, the committee concluded that
the public is deeply concerned about the privacy and security of personal
health information, and that the HIPAA Privacy Rule has reduced, but not
eliminated, those concerns. In some surveys, the majority of respondents
were not comfortable with their health information being provided for
health research except with notice and express consent. But in others, a
majority of respondents were willing to forgo notice and consent if various safeguards and specific types of research were specified. As noted in
Chapter 3, surveys also indicate that the majority of Americans are supportive of health research, but they lack information about how research is
conducted and are rarely informed about research results that may have a
direct impact on their health.
The concerns of Health researchers
Researchers began raising concerns about the potential impact of the
HIPAA Privacy Rule on health research when the regulations were first
proposed. However, researchers did not play a large role in shaping the final
version of the HIPAA Privacy Rule published by HHS. Most of the comments that HHS received from the research community during the notice
of proposed rulemaking period were focused on urging HHS not to include
research within the HIPAA Privacy Rule regulations at all. Few comments
suggested alternatives to the regulatory scheme proposed by HHS, or gave
HHS constructive comments on how to incorporate the research provisions
into the rule (IOM, 2006).
After the date of compliance for the HIPAA Privacy Rule, the concerns of researchers escalated. Numerous anecdotal reports and expert
opinions, along with a number of surveys, indicate that the HIPAA Privacy Rule has had a negative effect on the ability of researchers to conduct valid research due to new restrictions on access to health data, and
has not produced a measurable increase in the protection of data used in
research (NCVHS, 2003; Ramirez and Niederhuber, 2003; Tovino, 2004;
Walker, 2005) (see also Chapter 5). Because of the reported concerns
about the HIPAA Privacy Rule’s effect on research, several organizations
have provided HHS with recommendations on how to improve the way
the HIPAA Privacy Rule regulates research. The past recommendations
of the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics, the Association of American Medical Colleges, and the HHS Secretary’s Advisory
­Committee on Human Research Protections are listed in Appendix A. As
noted in the methods section below, several new surveys were also undertaken during the course of this study to provide more current, systematic
data for the committee’s deliberations. The committee also reviewed
a number of studies that attempted to assess the impact of the HIPAA

origins of the study
The 2003 Annual Report of the President’s Cancer Panel, which made
a number of recommendations regarding issues affecting cancer survivors,
also included a recommendation that “The Institute of Medicine (IOM)
should be commissioned to evaluate the impact of HIPAA provisions and
provide guidance to legislators on amendments needed to make this law
serve the interests of cancer survivors and others” after concluding that
the HIPAA Privacy Rule slowed research on cancer survivors in a variety
of ways (President’s Cancer Panel, 2004). The Panel’s 2005–2006 report
again called for an evaluation of the HIPAA Privacy Rule provisions that
were thought to inhibit the ability to track and collect data for research on
cancer survivors (President’s Cancer Panel, 2006). Based on those recommendations, the IOM’s National Cancer Policy Forum held a workshop on
the topic, inviting a diverse group of speakers representing many relevant
stakeholders from academia, industry, and the public. The proceedings of
that workshop, held June 16, 2006, were then reported in a summary published by the IOM (IOM, 2006).
At that workshop, speakers reiterated many of the challenges described
above in applying the HIPAA Privacy Rule to health research, noting that
despite having several years to learn and adapt to the new rules, as well as
new guidance from HHS and the Office for Civil Rights (OCR), ­researchers
are still facing difficulty in working under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Although
the goal of the HIPAA Privacy Rule was to establish a uniform set of federal
standards to be applied nationwide, many speakers testified that there is
enormous variation among institutions and oversight boards in the way the
regulations are interpreted and applied, with many adopting exceptionally
conservative interpretations. Moreover, it was reported that many smaller
institutions lacked the staff and infrastructure to implement the regulations
on research and ensure compliance, and were opting out of research entirely
to avoid the risk of penalties for HIPAA noncompliance (IOM, 2006).
However, many speakers also stressed the need to maintain or strengthen
the privacy protections for personal health information.
Following the publication of the IOM’s National Cancer Policy Forum’s
workshop summary, the governing board of the National Academies determined that a consensus study to examine the effects of the HIPAA Privacy
Rule on health research would be of value, and funding for the study
was obtained from diverse sources, including the National Institutes of
Health, the National Cancer Institute, the Burroughs Wellcome Fund, the
­Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the American Heart Association (AHA)/

American Stroke Association, the American Cancer Society, the American
Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO), and C-Change.
Committee appointment and Charge
The funders of the study asked the IOM to examine the available
evidence to determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule was impacting the
conduct of health research. As a major funder of the study, HHS had a
particular interest in distinguishing direct effects of mandates in the HIPAA
Privacy Rule on the conduct of research from the variable influence of
interpretation and implementation of the regulations by various institutions
and oversight boards.
To examine the question, the IOM appointed a 15-member committee
with a broad range of expertise and experience covering various fields of
health research; privacy of health information; health law, regulation, and
ethics; human research protections and IRBs; health center administration;
use and protection of electronic health information; and patient advocacy.
The IOM committee was charged with the task of proposing recommendations that would facilitate the efficient and effective conduct of responsible
health research while maintaining or strengthening the privacy protections
of identifiable health information (Box 1-1).
methods
The committee reviewed the available published literature and obtained
input from experts in the field and interested individuals and institutions.
The literature review, as well as the proceedings of the IOM workshop
described above, demonstrated there was a dearth of systematic data to
determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule was having an impact on health
research. Because many published reports were based on isolated anecdotes
or small surveys, the IOM committee sought larger surveys with national
coverage. As a result, the IOM, in consultation with committee members,
took the unusual step of commissioning several surveys to assess current
perceptions among health researchers of the effect of the HIPAA Privacy
Rule on research, and to gauge the public’s perception of and expectations
for privacy in health research. The first survey entailed a national webbased survey of U.S. epidemiologists overseen by Dr. Roberta Ness at the
University of Pittsburgh. A second project, undertaken by Sarah Greene and
Dr. Ed Wagner at the Group Health Center for Health Studies in Seattle,
involved a survey of HMO Research Network (HMORN) investigators and
 The surveys were commissioned with private funding. No federal funds were used to sup-

port collection of survey data.

INTRODUCTION

BOX 1-1
Committee Statement of Task
An Institute of Medicine committee will investigate the effects on health
research of the Privacy Rule regulations implementing the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) section on Administrative Simplification and prepare a report. In conducting the study, the committee will:
1. Consider the range of study types, such as clinical trials, epidemiologic designs,
research using tissue repositories and databases, public health research,
and health services research, to the extent that available data and evidence
allow;
2. Consider research carried out by the full range of sponsors: government, public and private academic, and for-profit sectors, including the pharmaceutical,
biotechnology, and medical device industries;
3. Review provisions of the Privacy Rule relevant to health research, including
those dealing with authorizations and accounting of disclosures of personal
health information, deidentification of data, reviews preparatory to research,
and others, and on reviewing them, may identify provisions that merit priority
attention and analysis;
4. Consider issues of interpretation and implementation of the Privacy Rule, as
well as of harmonization with overlapping provisions of the Common Rule and
Food and Drug Administration regulations, which have existed much longer;
5. Examine the potential impact of the Rule on public health research, on the
recruitment of research subjects for studies, on carrying out research internationally, and on research using data and biomaterials in databases and tissue
repositories; and
6. Consider the needs for privacy of identifiable personal health information and
the value of such privacy to patients and the public. As data and evidence
allow, the needs and benefits of patient privacy will be balanced against the
needs, risks, and benefits of identifiable health information for various kinds of
health research. The committee will formulate recommendations for alterations
or retention of the status quo accordingly.

a survey of HMORN Institutional Review Boards. A Harris Interactive Poll
of the public, developed by Alan Westin of the Privacy Consulting Group,
served as the third survey. Detailed descriptions of the methodologies and
analysis for each of the surveys can be found in Appendix B. Several
additional surveys and focus groups were undertaken independently by
organizations, with the intent of providing input to the IOM committee.
Those organizations include AcademyHealth, AHA, ASCO, the American
Association of Central Cancer Registries, and the Association of Academic
Health Centers.

BEYOND THE HIPAA PRIVACY RULE

Surveys are useful in identifying the main issues surrounding the
HIPAA Privacy Rule’s regulation of research, but it is important to recognize the limitations of opinion surveys. As noted briefly in Chapters 2,
3, and 5, designing quality surveys presents many challenges. These challenges include ensuring that the respondents are truly representative of the
population being surveyed, developing the wording of questions, framing
the responses provided, analyzing the relationship and potential influence
of questions to each other in the survey process, and applying statistical
analyses to the data acquired. Although they are helpful in gaining the perspective of populations of interest, such as current members of the health
research community or of the public, survey methods are also prone to
subject bias and error. Motivational factors may influence the results of
surveys that address sensitive subjects, and respondents may be unwilling
to provide accurate information for reasons of self-protection or personal
gain (Wentland and Smith, 1993). In addition, experiments in social psychology suggest that responses to survey questions regarding attitude are
influenced by environment, survey type, and the context in which the question is presented (Tourangeau et al., 2000). The committee’s intention in
presenting findings from opinion surveys, including those commissioned by
the IOM, is to shed light on opinions regarding the influence of the HIPAA
Privacy Rule on health research and patient privacy; it is not an attempt to
definitively determine cause and effect.
THE COMMITTEE’S CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The recommendations put forth in this report represent committee
consensus that was developed through review and discussion of the above
information sources. There are three general methods for improving the
current system: (1) HHS and its OCR could provide more guidance to
IRBs, Privacy Boards, institutions, and other participants and stakeholders,
which is the simplest and most direct way to achieve change; (2) regulatory changes to the HIPAA Privacy Rule provisions may be necessary in
some cases, but are more difficult to undertake; and (3) statutory change of
HIPAA or other legislation at the federal or state level, which is the most
difficult to accomplish. The committee tried to be as modest as possible in
proposing recommendations to achieve its goals, with the aim of making it
easier to effect change if policy makers agree with our proposals.
After reviewing the available evidence, the committee concluded that
covered entities, Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), Privacy Boards, and
researchers alike have faced difficulty in interpreting and implementing
the complex regulation. There is a great deal of variation in how these
stakeholders have responded to the HIPAA Privacy Rule, with many covered entities, IRBs, and Privacy Boards interpreting the HIPAA Privacy

Rule very conservatively. These interpretations impede some important
research activities, and can also limit the validity and generalizability of
some research results. The variation in interpretation is especially problematic for multi-institutional research projects. Gaining IRB or Privacy Board
approval from multiple institutions for a particular project is challenging
and can lead to significant delays or even abandoned studies, and also can
result in protocol variations at different research sites. The committee also
found that for some provisions of the HIPAA Privacy Rule, the burdens are
heavy and the privacy protections in research are small.
Therefore, the committee concluded that the HIPAA Privacy Rule,
as currently interpreted and implemented, impedes research without protecting privacy as well as it should. The committee’s approach to its task
evolved as the study progressed and the group began thinking about potential recommendations. The committee decided to approach the problem in
two ways. First, the committee proposes a bold, innovative, and more uniform approach to the dual challenge of protecting privacy and supporting
beneficial and responsible research. Although this new approach may be
harder to implement in the short term, it should help stimulate fresh ideas
about the best ways to protect privacy and improve research as the nation
thinks about these two interrelated values over the next several years.
Second, the committee makes a series of detailed proposals to improve the
HIPAA Privacy Rule and associated guidance. These recommendations aim
to reduce variability in the interpretation of the HIPAA Privacy Rule as
applied to research, and to facilitate important health research within the
scope of the HIPAA Privacy Rule through revised and expanded guidance,
or by altering some provisions that pose a hindrance to research but do not
provide significant privacy protections. The committee’s last set of recommendations do not directly relate to the HIPAA Privacy Rule, but should be
adopted regardless of which of the committee’s approaches is implemented
(the new framework or revisions to the HIPAA Privacy Rule and associated guidance). These include improving the security of identifiable health
information, encouraging service on Institutional Review Boards and Privacy Boards, and providing more information to the public about research
results, how health research is conducted, and how it contributes to the
welfare of individuals and society as a whole.

 Responsible health research is methodologically sound, scientifically valid, protects the
rights and interests of study subjects, and addresses a question or problem relevant to improving human health.

Framework of the report
Chapter 2 describes the value and importance of health information
privacy with an overview of how informational privacy has been protected
by law; a review of survey data on public opinions, expectations, and experiences; and a discussion on the security of health data.
Chapter 3 describes the value and importance of responsible health

The Value and Importance of
Health Information Privacy

Ethical health research and privacy protections both provide valuable
benefits to society. Health research is vital to improving human health and
health care. Protecting patients involved in research from harm and preserving their rights is essential to ethical research. The primary justification for
protecting personal privacy is to protect the interests of individuals. In contrast, the primary justification for collecting personally identifiable health
information for health research is to benefit society. But it is important to
stress that privacy also has value at the societal level, because it permits
complex activities, including research and public health activities to be carried out in ways that protect individuals’ dignity. At the same time, health
research can benefit individuals, for example, when it facilitates access to
new therapies, improved diagnostics, and more effective ways to prevent
illness and deliver care.
The intent of this chapter is to define privacy and to delineate its
importance to individuals and society as a whole. The value and importance
of health research will be addressed in Chapter 3.
Concepts and Value of Privacy
Definitions
Privacy has deep historical roots (reviewed by Pritts, 2008; ­ Westin,
1967), but because of its complexity, privacy has proven difficult to

define and has been the subject of extensive, and often heated, debate by
­philosophers, sociologists, and legal scholars. The term “privacy” is used
frequently, yet there is no universally accepted definition of the term, and
confusion persists over the meaning, value, and scope of the concept of
privacy. At its core, privacy is experienced on a personal level and often
means different things to different people (reviewed by Lowrance, 1997;
Pritts, 2008). In modern society, the term is used to denote different, but
overlapping, concepts such as the right to bodily integrity or to be free from
intrusive searches or surveillance. The concept of privacy is also context
specific, and acquires a different meaning depending on the stated reasons
for the information being gathered, the intentions of the parties involved,
as well as the politics, convention and cultural expectations (Nissenbaum,
2004; NRC, 2007b).
Our report, and the Privacy Rule itself, are concerned with health
informational privacy. In the context of personal information, concepts
of privacy are closely intertwined with those of confidentiality and security. However, although privacy is often used interchangeably with the
terms “confidentiality” and “security,” they have distinct meanings. Privacy
addresses the question of who has access to personal information and under
what conditions. Privacy is concerned with the collection, storage, and use
of personal information, and examines whether data can be collected in the
first place, as well as the justifications, if any, under which data collected for
one purpose can be used for another (secondary) purpose. An important
issue in privacy analysis is whether the individual has authorized particular
uses of his or her personal information (Westin, 1967).
Confidentiality safeguards information that is gathered in the context
of an intimate relationship. It addresses the issue of how to keep information exchanged in that relationship from being disclosed to third parties
(Westin, 1976). Confidentiality, for example, prevents physicians from
disclosing information shared with them by a patient in the course of a
­physician–patient relationship. Unauthorized or inadvertent disclosures
of data gained as part of an intimate relationship are breaches of con­
fidentiality (Gostin and Hodge, 2002; NBAC, 2001).
Security can be defined as “the procedural and technical measures
required (a) to prevent unauthorized access, modification, use, and dissemination of data stored or processed in a computer system, (b) to prevent
any deliberate denial of service, and (c) to protect the system in its entirety
from physical harm” (Turn and Ware, 1976). Security helps keep health
 The National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics has noted that the term “second-

ary uses” of health data is ill defined and therefore urged abandoning it in favor of precise
description of each use. Consequently, the IOM committee has chosen to minimize use of the
term in this report.

records safe from unauthorized use. When someone hacks into a computer
system, there is a breach of security (and also potentially, a breach of con­
fidentiality). No security measure, however, can prevent invasion of privacy
by those who have authority to access the record (Gostin, 1995).
The Importance of Privacy
There are a variety of reasons for placing a high value on protecting
the privacy, confidentiality, and security of health information (reviewed by
Pritts, 2008). Some theorists depict privacy as a basic human good or right
with intrinsic value (Fried, 1968; Moore, 2005; NRC, 2007a; Terry and
Francis, 2007). They see privacy as being objectively valuable in itself, as
an essential component of human well-being. They believe that respecting
privacy (and autonomy) is a form of recognition of the attributes that give
humans their moral uniqueness.
The more common view is that privacy is valuable because it facilitates
or promotes other fundamental values, including ideals of personhood
(Bloustein, 1967; Gavison, 1980; Post, 2001; Solove, 2006; Taylor, 1989;
Westin, 1966) such as:
•
•
•
•

Personal autonomy (the ability to make personal decisions)
Individuality
Respect
Dignity and worth as human beings

The bioethics principle nonmaleficence requires safeguarding personal
privacy. Breaches of privacy and confidentiality not only may affect a
person’s dignity, but can cause harm. When personally identifiable health
information, for example, is disclosed to an employer, insurer, or family member, it can result in stigma, embarrassment, and discrimination.
Thus, without some assurance of privacy, people may be reluctant to
provide candid and complete disclosures of sensitive information even to
their physicians. Ensuring privacy can promote more effective communication between physician and patient, which is essential for quality of care,
enhanced autonomy, and preventing economic harm, embarrassment, and
discrimination (Gostin, 2001; NBAC, 1999; Pritts, 2002). However, it
should also be noted that perceptions of privacy vary among individuals
and various groups. Data that are considered intensely private by one person may not be by others (Lowrance, 2002).
But privacy has value even in the absence of any embarrassment or

tangible harm. Privacy is also required for developing interpersonal relationships with others. Although some emphasize the need for privacy to
establish intimate relationships (Allen, 1997), others take a broader view
of privacy as being necessary to maintain a variety of social relationships
(Rachels, 1975). By giving us the ability to control who knows what about
us and who has access to us, privacy allows us to alter our behavior with
different people so that we may maintain and control our various social
relationships (Rachels, 1975). For example, people may share different
information with their boss than they would with their doctor.
Most discussions on the value of privacy focus on its importance to the
individual. Privacy can be seen, however, as also having value to society
as a whole (Regan, 1995). Privacy furthers the existence of a free society
(Gavison, 1980). For example, preserving privacy from widespread surveillance can be seen as protecting not only the individual’s private sphere, but
also society as a whole: Privacy contributes to the maintenance of the type
of society in which we want to live (Gavison, 1980; Regan, 1995).
Privacy can foster socially beneficial activities like health research. Individuals are more likely to participate in and support research if they believe
their privacy is being protected. Protecting privacy is also seen by some as
enhancing data quality for research and quality improvement initiatives.
When individuals avoid health care or engage in other privacy-protective
behaviors, such as withholding information, inaccurate and incomplete
data are entered into the health care system. These data, which are subsequently used for research, public health reporting, and outcomes analysis,
carry with them the same vulnerabilities (Goldman, 1998).
The bioethics principle of respect for persons also places importance on
individual autonomy, which allows individuals to make decisions for themselves, free from coercion, about matters that are important to their own
well-being. U.S. society also places a high value on individual ­autonomy,
and one way to respect persons and enhance individual ­ autonomy is to
ensure that people can make the choice about when, and whether, personal information (particularly sensitive information) can be shared with
others.
Public Views of Health Information Privacy
American society places a high value on individual rights, personal
choice, and a private sphere protected from intrusion. Medical records can
include some of the most intimate details about a person’s life. They document a patient’s physical and mental health, and can include information
on social behaviors, personal relationships, and financial status (Gostin and
Hodge, 2002). Accordingly, surveys show that medical privacy is a major
concern for many Americans, as outlined below (reviewed by Pritts, 2008;

Westin, 2007). As noted in Chapter 1, however, there are some limits to
what can be learned from surveys (Tourangeau et al., 2000; Wentland,
1993; Westin, 2007). For example, how the questions and responses are
worded and framed can significantly influence the results and their interpretation. Also, responses are biased when respondents self-report measures
of attitudes, behavior, and feelings in such a way as to represent themselves
favorably.
In a 1999 survey of consumer attitudes toward health privacy, three
out of four people reported that they had significant concerns about the
privacy and confidentiality of their medical records (Forrester Research,
1999). In a more recent survey, conducted in 2005 after the implementation
of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy
Rule, 67 percent of respondents still said they were concerned about the
privacy of their medical records, suggesting that the Privacy Rule had not
effectively alleviated public concern about health privacy. Ethnic and racial
minorities showed the greatest concern among the respondents. Moreover,
the survey showed that many consumers were unfamiliar with the HIPAA
privacy protections. Only 59 percent of respondents recalled receiving a
HIPAA privacy notice, and only 27 percent believed they had more rights
than they had before receiving the notice (Forrester Research, 2005). One
out of eight respondents also admitted to engaging in behaviors intended
to protect their privacy, even at the expense of risking dangerous health
effects. These behaviors included lying to their doctors about symptoms or
behaviors, refusing to provide information or providing inaccurate information, paying out of pocket for care that is covered by insurance, and
avoiding care altogether (Forrester Research, 2005).
A series of polls conducted by Harris Interactive suggest, however,
that the privacy of health information has improved since implementation
of the Privacy Rule. Prior to its creation, a 1993 survey by Harris Interactive showed that 27 percent of Americans believed their personal medical
information had been released improperly in the past 3 years. In contrast,
14 percent and 12 percent of respondents believed this had happened to
them in 2005 and 2007, respectively (Harris Interactive, 2005, 2007). In
the 2005 survey, about two-thirds of respondents reported having received
a HIPAA privacy notice, and of these people, 67 percent said the privacy
notice increased their confidence that their medical information is being
handled properly (Harris Interactive, 2005).
Responses to other questions on recent public opinion polls conducted
by Harris Interactive only partially corroborate these findings. In one survey, 70 percent of respondents indicated that they are generally satisfied
with how their personal health information is handled with regard to
privacy protections and security. Nearly 60 percent of the respondents
reported that they believe the existing federal and state health privacy pro-

tection laws provide a reasonable level of privacy protection for their health
information (Harris Interactive, 2005). Nonetheless, half of the respondents
also believed that “[P]atients have lost all control today over how their
medical records are obtained and used by organizations outside the direct
patient health care such as life insurers, employers, and government health
agencies.” In another survey, 83 percent of respondents reported that they
trust health care providers to protect the privacy and confidentiality of their
personal medical records and health information (Westin, 2007). However,
in that survey, 58 percent of respondents believed the privacy of personal
medical records and health information is not protected well enough today
by federal and state laws and organizational practices.
A number of studies suggest that the relative strength of privacy, confidentiality, and security protections can play an important role in people’s
concerns about privacy (reviewed by Pritts, 2008). When presented with
the possibility that there would be a nationwide system of electronic medical records, one survey found 70 percent of respondents were concerned
that sensitive personal medical record information might be leaked because
of weak data security, 69 percent expressed concern that there could be
more sharing of medical information without the patient’s knowledge, and
69 percent were concerned that strong enough data security will not be
installed in the new computer system.
Confidentiality is particularly important to adolescents who seek health
care. When adolescents perceive that health services are not confidential,
they report that they are less likely to seek care, particularly for reproductive health matters or substance abuse (Weddle and Kokotailo, 2005). In
addition, the willingness of a person to make self-disclosures necessary to
mental health and substance abuse treatment may decrease as the perceived
negative consequences of a breach of confidentiality increase (Petrila, 1999;
Roback and Shelton, 1995; Taube and Elwork, 1990). These studies show
that protecting the privacy of health information is important for ensuring
that individuals seek and obtain quality care.
The potential for economic harm resulting from discrimination in health
insurance and employment is also a concern for many people (reviewed by
Pritts, 2008). Polls consistently show that people are most concerned about
insurers and employers accessing their health information without their permission (Forrester Research, 2005; PSRA, 1999). This concern arises from
fears about employer and insurer discrimination. Concerns about employer
discrimination based on health information, in particular, increased 16
percent between 1999 and 2005, with 52 percent of respondents in the
later survey expressing concern that their information might be seen by an
employer and used to limit job opportunities (Forrester Research, 2005;
PSRA, 1999). Reports alleging that major employers such as Wal-Mart base

some of their hiring decisions on the health of applicants suggest that these
concerns may be justified (Greenhouse and Barbaro, 2005).
Studies show that individuals are especially concerned about genetic
information being used inappropriately by their insurers and employers
(reviewed by Pritts, 2008). Even health care providers appear to be affected
by these concerns. In a survey of cancer-genetics specialists, more than half
indicated that they would pay out of pocket rather than bill their insurance
companies for genetic testing, for fear of genetic discrimination (Hudson,
2007). Although surveys do not reveal a significant percentage of indi­
viduals who have experienced such discrimination, geneticists have reported
that approximately 550 individuals were refused employment, fired, or
denied life insurance based on their genetic constitution (NBAC, 1999).
In addition, a study in the United Kingdom suggested that life insurers in
that country do not have a full grasp on the meaning of genetic information and do not assess or act in accord with the actuarial risks presented
by the information (Low et al., 1998). There is, therefore, some legitimate
basis to individuals’ concerns about potential economic harm and the need
to protect the privacy of their genetic information. Recent passage of the
Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act in the United States will hopefully begin to address some of these concerns.
Patient Attitudes About Privacy in Health Research
Ideally, there would be empirical evidence regarding the privacy value
of all the specific Privacy Rule provisions that impact researchers, but there
are only limited data on this topic from the consumer/patient perspective.
A few studies have attempted to examine the public’s attitudes about the
use of health information in research. However, few have attempted to
do so with respect to the intricacies of the protections afforded by the
­Privacy Rule or the Common Rule, which are likely not well known to
the public.
A review by Westin of 43 national surveys with health privacy questions fielded between 1993 and September 2007 identified 9 surveys with
one or more questions about health research and privacy (Westin, 2007). In
some, the majority of respondents were not comfortable with their health

information being provided for health research except with notice and
express consent. But in others, a majority of respondents were willing to
forgo notice and consent if various safeguards and specific types of research
were offered. For example, a recent Harris Poll found that 63 percent of
respondents would give general consent to the use of their medical records
for research, as long as there were guarantees that no personally identifiable
health information would be released from such studies (Harris Interactive,
2007). This is similar to the percentage of people willing to participate in
a “clinical research study” (Research!America, 2007; Woolley and Propst,
2005) (see also Chapter 3). A 2006 British survey also found strong support for the use of personally identifiable information without consent for
public health research and surveillance, via the National Cancer Registry
(Barrett et al., 2007).
Westin noted that opinions varied in the surveys according to developments on the health care scene and with consumer privacy trends. He
concluded from this review that the majority of consumers are positive
about health research, and if asked in general terms, support their medical
information being made available for research. However, he also noted that
most of these surveys presented the choice in ways that did not articulate
the key permission process, and that there was much ambiguity in who
­“researchers” are, what kind of “health research” is involved, and how
the promised protection of personal identities would be ensured (Westin,
2007).
Reviewing the handful of detailed studies examining patient views of
the use of their medical information in research through surveys, structured
interviews, or focus groups, Pritts determined that a number of common
themes emerge (reviewed by Pritts, 2008):
•

•

•

Patients were generally very supportive of research provided safeguards are established to protect the privacy and security of their
medical information (Damschroder et al., 2007; Kass et al., 2003;
Robling et al., 2004; Westin, 2007; Willison et al., 2007).
Patients were much more comfortable with the use of anonymized
data (e.g., where obvious identifiers have been removed) than fully
identifiable data for research (Damschroder et al., 2007; Kass et
al., 2003; Robling et al., 2004; Whiddett et al., 2006).
Patients were less comfortable with sharing information about
“sensitive” conditions such as mental health with researchers
(Damschroder et al., 2007; Robling et al., 2004).

In studies where patients were able to provide unstructured comments,
they expressed concern about the potential that anonymized data would be
reidentified. They were also concerned that insurers or employers or others
who could discriminate against subjects could potentially access informa-

tion maintained by researchers (Damschroder et al., 2007; Kass et al., 2003;
Robling et al., 2004). Some feared that researchers would sell information
to drug companies or other third parties ­(Damschroder et al., 2007).
Although supportive of research, the majority of patients in these
­studies expressed a desire to be consulted before their information was
released for research (Damschroder et al., 2007; Kass et al., 2003; Robling
et al., 2004; Westin, 2007; Whiddett et al., 2006; Willison et al., 2007).
Some surveys also show that even if researchers would receive no directly
identifying information (e.g., name, address, and health insurance number),
the majority of respondents still wanted to have some input before their
medical records were disclosed (Damschroder et al., 2007; Robling et al.,
2004; Willison et al., 2007). For example, in a 2005 Australian survey,
67 percent of respondents indicated they would be willing to allow their
­deidentified health records to be used for medical research purposes, but 81
percent wanted to be asked first (Flannery and Tokley, 2005).
Studies indicate that public support for research and willingness to
share health information can vary with the purpose or type of activity being
conducted (reviewed by Pritts, 2008). Studies have found there was less
support for activities that were primarily for a commercial purpose, or that
might be used in a manner that would not help patients (Damschroder et
al., 2007; Willison et al., 2007). Some participants expressed concern that
some researchers were motivated by monetary rewards and that decision
makers would act out of self-interest (Damschroder et al., 2007).
One recent study suggests that the biggest predictor of whether
patients are willing to share their medical records with researchers is the
patients’ trust that their information will be kept private and confidential
­(Damschroder et al., 2007). In this study, the patients who most trusted the
Veterans Affairs system to keep their medical records private were more
likely to accept less stringent requirements for informed consent. Thirtyfour percent of veterans who participated in intensive focus groups using
deliberative democracy were willing to allow researchers associated with the
Veterans Health Administration to use their medical records without any
procedures for patient input, subject to Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approval, and another 17 percent reported that patients should have to ask
for their medical records to be excluded from research studies (opt-out).
But participants in focus groups also have expressed a desire to be
informed of how their health information was used for research. This desire
was tied to a sense of altruism—they wanted to know that their information was useful and that they may have contributed to helping others by
allowing their medical records to be used for research (Damschroder et al.,
2007; Robling et al., 2004). The veterans also recommended methods to
give research participants more control over how their medical records are
used in research. These recommendations included requiring that participants are fully informed about how their medical records are being used

in research; providing assurances that the research being conducted will
benefit fellow veterans; updating research participants about findings and
ongoing research; and setting out clear and consistent consequences for
anyone who violates a patient’s privacy (Damschroder et al., 2007).
The recent Harris poll commissioned by the Institute of Medicine
(IOM) committee for this study found that 8 percent of respondents
had been asked to have their medical information used in research, but
declined. When asked why, 30 percent indicated they were concerned about
the privacy and confidentiality of their personal information, but many
other reasons were also commonly cited (ranging from 5 to 24 percent of
respondents), including worry that participation would be risky, painful, or
unpleasant; lack of trust in the researchers; or belief that it would not help
their condition or their family (Westin, 2007).
Some studies also suggest that individuals’ attitudes toward the use of
their medical records in research may be influenced by a person’s state of
health. Although the commissioned Harris Poll found that people who are
in only fair health, who have a disability, or who had taken a genetic test
were slightly more concerned than the public about health researchers seeing their medical records (55 percent versus 50 percent), other data suggest
that people with health concerns may be more supportive of using medical records in research. For example, qualitative market research by the
National Health Council showed that individuals with chronic conditions
have a very favorable attitude toward the implementation of electronic
personal health records (EPHRs). During the focus group discussions, participants noted that EPHRs could be very advantageous in medical research
and were supportive of this use even though many had expressed concern
about the privacy and confidentiality of EPHRs (Balch et al., 2005, 2006).
Although the Council did not specifically ask about attitudes toward health
research and privacy, these results suggest that individuals with chronic
conditions may be more likely to grant researchers access to their medical
records, and to place less emphasis on protecting privacy than members of
the general population.
Also, a Johns Hopkins University survey of patients having, or at risk
for, serious medical conditions examined these patients’ attitudes about the
use of their medical records in research, and compared those results to polls
from the general population. Thirty-one percent of respondents stated that
medical researchers should have access to their medical records without
their permission if it would help to advance medical knowledge.
In contrast, the recent Harris poll of the public found that 19 percent
of respondents would be willing to forgo consent to use personal medical
and health information, as long as the study never revealed their identity
 The survey was conducted online by Harris Interactive between September 11 and 18,

2007, with 2,392 respondents. The methodology for the survey is described in Appendix B.

and it was supervised by an IRB (Westin, 2007). An additional 8 percent
indicated they would be willing to give general consent in advance to have
personally identifiable medical or health information used in future research
projects without the researchers having to contact them, and 1 percent said
researchers should be free to use their personal medical and health information without their consent at all. Thus, 28 percent of respondents would be
willing to grant researchers access to their medical records without giving
specific consent for each research project. Thirty-eight percent believed
they should be asked to consent to each research study seeking to use their
personally identifiable medical or health information, and 13 percent did
not want researchers to contact them or to use their personal or health
information under any circumstances. However, those who preferred not
to be contacted at all were actually less likely than those who would grant
conditional permission to have declined participating in a research study.
Notably, 20 percent of respondents were unsure how to respond to the
question about notice and consent for research.
Among the 38 percent who said they wanted notice and consent,
80 percent indicated that they would want to know the purpose of the
research, and 46 percent wanted to know specifically whether the research
could help their health condition or those of family members. Sixty-two
percent indicated that knowing about the specific research study and who
would be running it would allow the respondent to decide whether to trust
the researchers. A little more than half of the respondents (54 percent) said
they would be worried that their personally identifiable information may be
disclosed outside the study. Among those 54 percent, three-quarters agreed
with the statement “I would feel violated and my trust in the researchers
betrayed.” Between 39 and 67 percent were concerned about discrimination
in a government program, by an employer, or in obtaining life or health
insurance (Westin, 2007).
However, about 70 percent of all respondents indicated that they trusted
health researchers to protect the privacy and confidentiality of the medical
records and health information they obtain about research participants.
Furthermore, among respondents who had participated in health research,
only 2 percent reported that any of their personally identifiable medical
information used in a study was given to anyone outside the research staff,
and half of those disclosures were actually made to other researchers or
research institutions (Westin, 2007).
In summary, very limited data are available to assess the privacy value
of the Privacy Rule provisions that impact researchers. Surveys indicate
that the public is deeply concerned about the privacy and security of personal health information, and that the HIPAA Privacy Rule has perhaps
reduced—but not eliminated—those concerns. Patients were generally very
supportive of research, provided safeguards were established to protect the
privacy and security of their medical information, although some surveys

indicate that a significant portion of the public would still prefer to control
access to their medical records via consent, even if the information is anonymized. Studies indicate that public support for research and willingness to
share health information varies with health status and the type of research
conducted, and depends on the patients’ trust that their information will be
kept private and confidential. An understanding the public’s attitude toward
privacy is important throughout the rest of this report, because many of the
IOM committee’s recommendations affect the nature of the privacy protections afforded by the federal health research regulations.
Historical Development of Legal Protections
of Health Information Privacy
The medical community has long recognized the importance of protecting privacy in maintaining public trust in doctors and researchers, and
codes of medical ethics reflect a desire to increase this public trust. Since
the time of Hippocrates, physicians have pledged to keep information
about their patients private and confidential (Feld and Feld, 2005). The
­Hippocratic Oath states, “What I may see or hear in the course of the
treatment or even outside of the treatment in regard to the life of men,
which on no account one must spread abroad, I will keep to myself. . . .”
This pledge to privacy has been included in the code of ethics of nearly all
health care professionals in the United States. For example, the first Code
of ­Ethics of the American Medical Association in 1847 included the concept
of confidentiality (OTA, 1993).
The value of health information privacy has also been recognized by
affording it protection under the law (reviewed by Pritts, 2008). The rules
for protecting the privacy of health information in the clinical care and
health research contexts developed along fairly distinct paths until the
promulgation of the federal privacy regulations under HIPAA. Prior to
HIPAA, health information in the clinical setting was protected primarily
under a combination of federal and state constitutional law, as well as state
common law and statutory protections (Box 2-1).
In contrast, research practices have been governed largely by federal
regulations called the Common Rule, which have historically focused on
protecting individuals from physical and mental harm in clinical trials
(see subsequent sections of this chapter). Although the standards apply to
research that uses personally identifiable health information, the protection
of information is not their primary focus.

HEALTH INFORMATION PRIVACY

BOX 2-1
Overview of Privacy Protections in the Law
Constitutional Protections
Both federal and state constitutions generally afford citizens some protection for the privacy of their health information. However, with limited exceptions,
individuals are only protected against governmental intrusions into their personal
health information and may not raise constitutional concerns about private action.
Even when state action is involved, individuals rarely prevail on claims premised
on constitutional rights to informational privacy because state interests generally
outweigh the individual’s privacy interest.
The U.S. Constitution does not expressly provide a right to privacy, but the
courts have determined that various constitutional provisions implicitly create
zones of privacy that are protected by the Constitution. The privacy interests recognized include both the individual’s interest in making certain kinds of important
decisions, and the individual’s interest in avoiding disclosure of personal matters.
With respect to informational privacy, the courts have afforded limited constitutional protections, although the right is not absolute, with the courts weighing
factors such as the type of record and information that it contains, the potential
for harm in an unauthorized disclosure and the injury from disclosure to the relationship in which the record was generated against the public interest or need for
the disclosure, and the adequacy of safeguards to prevent unauthorized access
or disclosure. Several federal courts have expressly recognized the constitutional
right of privacy in connection with medical and prescription records.
All states have constitutional provisions similar to those in the U.S. Constitution, which give rise to an implied right of privacy. Unlike the U.S. Constitution,
however, constitutions in 10 states grant individuals an express right to privacy.
Courts have consistently determined that health or medical information is an area
of privacy that is protected by state constitutions.
Common Law Protections
State common law generally recognizes that some health care relationships
are based on maintaining the confidentiality of information obtained in the course
of care and affords a remedy when that confidentiality is breached. Traditionally,
the law’s regulation of “privacy” consisted essentially of the protection of confidentiality within the doctor–patient relationship. Courts have found that actions
may be maintained against private parties for unauthorized disclosures of health
information under a number of legal theories, including invasion of privacy, implied
breach of contract, breach of confidentiality, and breach of fiduciary relationship. Obtaining a remedy for disclosure of health information under any of these
­theories, however, is difficult.
In the health care context, the promise of confidentiality is intended to encourage patients to fully disclose their most personal information to assist in accurate

BOX 2-1 Continued
diagnosis and treatment. Courts have thus found the duty of confidentiality applies
to physicians, hospitals, psychiatrists, and social workers. The underlying duty
of confidentiality is not absolute, and the courts have indicated that there is no
breach of confidentiality when a disclosure is made as required by statute (e.g.,
mandatory reporting to state officials of infectious or contagious diseases) or
common law (e.g., a duty to disclose information concerning the safety of third
persons). The extent to which state common law protects the confidentiality of
health information in the evolving health care paradigm, where many people and
organizations that receive and maintain health information do not have a direct
relationship with the patient, is unclear. In most states, common law protections,
particularly in tort, have been codified in statute.
Statutory and Regulatory Protections
Since the 1970s, the trend has been to augment existing constitutional and
common law rights with statutory protections specifically designed to protect the
privacy and confidentiality of health information (see Table 2-1). Although the
common law continues to be important, the federal and state governments have
increasingly focused on promulgating distinct standards for the protection of
health information.
The shift to statutory and regulatory protections for health information was
largely a response to the changing nature of recordkeeping in general, and of the
nature of the provision of health care. As noted by the 1977 Privacy Protection
Study Commission, “The emergence of third-party payment plans; the use of
health care information for non-healthcare purposes; the growing involvement of
government agencies in virtually all aspects of health care; and the exponential
increase in the use of computers and automated information systems for healthcare record information have combined to put substantial pressure on traditional
confidentiality protections.”

Principles of Fair Information Practice
The framework in which detailed statutory and regulatory protections
of privacy originated was in the 1973 report of an advisory committee to
the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW), “designed
to call attention to issues of recordkeeping practice in the computer age that
may have profound significance for us all” (HEW, 1973). The principles
were intended to “provide a basis for establishing procedures that assure
the individual a right to participate in a meaningful way in decisions about
what goes into records about him and how that information shall be used”
(HEW, 1973). In addition to affording individuals the meaningful right
to control the collection, use, and disclosure of their information, the fair
information practices also impose affirmative responsibilities to safeguard
information on those who collect it (reviewed by Pritts, 2008).
The fundamental principles of fair information practice articulated in
the report have since been amplified and adopted in various forms at the
international, federal, and state levels (Gelman, 2008). The fair information
practices endorsed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD), which have been widely cited, include the following
principles (OECD, 1980):
•

•

•

•

Collection Limitation
There should be limits to the collection of personal data, and any
such data should be obtained by lawful and fair means and, where
appropriate, with the knowledge or consent of the data subject.
Data Quality
Personal data should be relevant to the purposes for which they are
to be used, and to the extent necessary for those purposes, should
be accurate, complete, and kept updated.
Purpose Specification
The purposes for which personal data are collected should be specified not later than at the time of data collection, and the subsequent
use limited to the fulfillment of those purposes or such others as
are not incompatible with those purposes, and as are specified on
each occasion of change of purpose.
Use Limitation
Personal data should not be disclosed, made available, or otherwise
used for purposes other than those specified in accordance with
[the Purpose Specification] except:
(a) with the consent of the data subject; or
(b) by the authority of law.

•

Security Safeguards
Personal data should be protected by reasonable security safeguards
against such risks as loss or unauthorized access, destruction, use,
modification, or disclosure of data.
Openness
There should be a general policy of openness about developments,
practices, and policies with respect to personal data. Means should
be readily available of establishing the existence and nature of
personal data, and the main purposes of their use, as well as the
identity and usual residence of the data controller.
Individual Participation
An individual should have the right to know whether a data con­
troller has data relating to him/her, to obtain a copy of the data
within a reasonable time in a form that is intelligible to him/her,
to obtain a reason if the request for access is denied, to challenge
such a denial, to challenge data relating to him/her, and, if the challenge is successful, to have the data erased, rectified, completed, or
amended.
Accountability
A data controller should be accountable for complying with measures, which give effect to the principles stated above.

These principles have been adopted at the federal and state levels to
varying degrees. The United States has taken a sector-driven approach
toward adopting the principles of fair information practices, with the federal and state governments promulgating statutes and regulations that apply
only to specific classes of record keepers or categories of records.,10
At the federal level, the fair information practices were first incorporated
into the Privacy Act of 1974, which governs the collection, use, and disclosure of personally identifiable data held by the federal government and some
of its contractors. Hospitals operated by the federal government and health
care or research institutions operated under federal contract are subject to
the Privacy Act, while other health care entities remained outside its scope
(Gostin, 1995). Nevertheless, the Privacy Act afforded perhaps the broadest

 The original 1973 HEW Advisory Committee contemplated and rejected the creation of

a centralized, federal approach to regulating the use of all automated personal data systems
(see HEW, 1973).
10 Europe, in contrast, has adopted fair information practices in a broad, more uniform
­fashion by incorporating them into the European Union (EU) Directive, which protects individuals with regard to the processing of any personal data and on the free movement of such
data. The EU Directive applies to personal data of many types, including medical and financial,
and widely applies to all who process such data, resulting in protections (Gelman, 2008).

protection for health information at the federal level until the promulgation
of the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
For their part, states have adopted (and continue to adopt) laws that
not only mirror the Privacy Act in protecting government-held records,
but also that afford broader protections for personally identifiable health
information held by private parties. However, these principles have not
been adopted uniformly among states, resulting in a patchwork of state
health privacy laws that provide little consistency from entity to entity or
from state to state.
For example, the states have enacted the fair information practice
restriction on use and disclosure of information in varying ways (reviewed
by Pritts, 2008). Some allow the disclosure of health information for
research without the individual’s permission and others require such permission. Others only require such permission to release only certain types
of information for research. Similarly, state statutes vary widely in how
they have applied the accountability principle, both in the way they provide remedies for breaches in confidentiality and security and with respect
to the standard imposed for initiating a suit. Also, only a few states have
statutorily required providers to undertake security measures to ensure that
health information is used and disclosed properly.
Security of Health Data
Protecting the security of data in health research is important because
health research requires the collection, storage, and use of large amounts of
personally identifiable health information, much of which may be sensitive
and potentially embarrassing. If security is breached, the individuals whose
health information was inappropriately accessed face a number of potential
harms. The disclosure of personal information may cause intrinsic harm
simply because that private information is known by others (Saver, 2006).
Another potential danger is economic harm. Individuals could lose their
job, health insurance, or housing if the wrong type of information becomes
public knowledge. Individuals could also experience social or psychological
harm. For example, the disclosure that an individual is infected with HIV
or another type of sexually transmitted infection can cause social isolation and/or other psychologically harmful results (Gostin, 2008). Finally,
security breaches could put individuals in danger of identity theft (Pritts,
2008).
Protecting the privacy of research participants and maintaining the
confidentiality of their data have always been paramount in research and a
fundamental tenet of clinical research. However, several highly publicized
examples of stolen or misplaced computers containing health data have
heightened the public’s concerns about the security of health data (for a list

94

BEYOND THE HIPAA PRIVACY RULE

of security breaches in health research, see Table 2-2). The extent to which
these breaches have caused tangible harm to the individuals involved is difficult to quantify (Pritts, 2008). A Government Accountability Office (GAO)
report studying major security breaches involving nonmedical personal
information concluded that most security breaches do not result in identity
theft (GAO, 2007). However, the lack of identity theft resulting from past
breaches is no guarantee that future breaches will not result in more serious
harm. A recent report from the Identity Theft Resources ­Center found that
identity theft is up by 69 percent for the first half of 2008, compared to the
same time period in 2007 (ITRC, 2008). Also, regardless of actual harm,
security breaches are problematic for health research because they undermine public trust, which is essential for patients to be willing to participate
in research (Hodge et al., 1999). A recent study found patients believe that
requiring researchers to have security plans encourages researchers to take
additional precautions to protect data (Damschroder et al., 2007). Moreover, data security is important to protect because it is a key component of
comprehensive privacy practices.
The HIPAA Security Rule and Its Limitations
The goals of security are threefold: to ensure that (1) only authorized
individuals see stored data; (2) they only see the data when they need
to use it for an authorized purpose; and (3) what they see is accurate.
­Traditionally, these goals have been pursued through protections intended
to make data processing safe from unauthorized access, alteration, deletion,
or transmission. The HIPAA Security Rule employs this traditional solution
to protecting security, and sets a floor for data security standards within
covered entities (Box 2-2).11
The HIPAA Security Rule has several major gaps in security protection.
First, like the HIPAA Privacy Rule, the HIPAA Security Rule only applies to
covered entities. Many researchers who rely on protected health information
(PHI)12 to conduct health research are not covered entities, and thus are
not required to implement any of the security requirements outlined in the
Security Rule. Although federal research regulations include protections of
privacy, there are no other laws that specifically require researchers to implement security protections for research data. Second, the HIPAA Security Rule
only protects electronic medical records; it does not require covered entities
11 Security Standards, 45 C.F.R. parts 160, 162, and 164 (2003). The final standards were
adopted on February 20, 2003. Covered entities were required to be in compliance with the
regulation on April 21, 2005 (and April 21, 2006, for small health plans).
12 Protected health information (PHI) refers to all personally identifiable health information
maintained by a HIPAA covered entity. 45 C.F.R. § 160.103 (2002).

BOX 2-2
The HIPAA Security Rule
The final HIPAA Security Standards were adopted on February 20, 2003.
Covered entities were required to be in compliance with the regulation on April 21,
2005 (and April 21, 2006, for small health plans). In designing the HIPAA Security
Rule, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) recognized that covered entities affected by this Rule were varied in terms of size, sophistication in
technology use, and relative risks. Rather than dictate specific technological solutions, HHS deliberately made the rule flexible and usable by all covered entities
regardless of size and purpose. HHS also specifically stayed away from requiring
any particular tech­nology solutions to protect security. The Rule was intended to
encourage covered entities to use future technology as it developed.
Unlike the HIPAA Privacy Rule, the HIPAA Security Rule only protects electronic protected health information (EPHI). The Security Rule requires covered
entities that process EPHI to maintain sufficient security measures to ensure the
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all EPHI. The Rule enumerates specific
administrative, technical, and physical security safeguards for covered entities to
implement. Each safeguard is either classified as “addressable” or “required.” For
the former, a “covered entity must conduct a risk analysis to determine whether
each specification is reasonable and appropriate for its unique situation,” and only
those safeguards that are “reasonable and appropriate” must be implemented.
Required security safeguards are those mandated by the Rule.
The Rule gives covered entities the responsibility for training their workforces
to comply with the security regulation and for having written security policies
and procedures in place. However, covered entities are only required to protect
against reasonably anticipated threats or hazards to the security of the data, and
reasonably anticipated uses or disclosures of such information that are not permitted under the Privacy Rule.

to implement any security protections for health information stored in paper
records. There is an ongoing effort to implement electronic health records.
However, many health records now exist only in paper form and may not

percent. In 2006, 1 year after implementation of the HIPAA security regulations, 25 percent of respondents described themselves as fully compliant with
the Security Rule, and 50 percent described themselves as 85 to 95 percent
compliant (compared to 17 percent of respondents in 2005 reporting they
were fully compliant, and 43 percent describing themselves as 85 to 95 percent compliant). More than half—54 percent—of respondents reported that
their covered entity had upgraded its electronic software system to comply
with the HIPAA Security Rule. All the respondents reported that their covered entity has an individual responsible for assessing data protection needs
and implementing solutions and staff training (compared to 89 percent in
2005), but the number of facilities reporting that they have an entire committee or task related to security decreased from 2005 (59 percent versus 78
percent) (AHIMA, 2006).
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has the ­authority
to enforce the HIPAA Security Rule, and has received 378 security complaints as of 2008 without issuing any fines or penalties. A recent report
issued by the HHS Office of Inspector General evaluated CMS’s oversight
and enforcement of the HIPAA Security Rule and “found that CMS had
taken limited steps to ensure that covered entities adequately implement
security protections” (OIG, 2008). However, a 2008 Resolution Agreement
entered into by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
and CMS with Seattle-based Providence Health & Services for breaches of
the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules may indicate that CMS is starting to
take a more affirmative approach to enforcement. The agreement requires
­Providence Health & Services to pay $100,000 and to implement a corrective action plan to ensure electronic patient information is appropriately
safeguarded against future security breaches (OCR, 2008). In addition,
CMS has recently partnered with PricewaterhouseCoopers to conduct security audits of covered entities to examine how well they are implementing
the requirements of the HIPAA Security Rule. Ten to 20 assessments are
planned for 2008 (Conn, 2008). Together these actions may have a positive
effect on the percentage of covered entities fully compliant with the HIPAA
Security Rule.
Regardless of whether the HIPAA Security Rule is actively enforced, the
other gaps in the HIPAA Security Rule’s protection of personal health information are problematic because enhanced security is necessary to reduce the
risk of data theft and to reinforce the public’s trust in the research community by diminishing anxiety about the potential for unintentional disclosure

of information. Thus, the IOM committee recommends that all institutions
(both covered entities and non-covered entities) in the health research community that are involved in the collection, use, and disclosure of personally
identifiable health information take strong measures to safeguard the security of health data. Given the differences among the missions and activities
of institutions in the health research community, some flexibility in the
implementation of specific security measures will be necessary.
Examples of measures that institutions should implement include
appointment of a security officer on IRBs and Privacy Boards to be responsible for assessing data protection needs and implementing solutions and
staff training; use of encryption and encoding techniques, especially for
laptops and removable media containing personally identifiable health
information; and implementation of a breach notification requirement,
so that patients may take steps to protect their identity in the event of a
breach (IOM, 2000). More generally, institutions should implement layers
of security protections, so that if security fails at one layer the breach will
likely be stopped by another layer of security protection. The publication
of best practices combined with a cooperative approach to compliance
with security standards—such as self-evaluation, security audits, and certification programs—would also promote progress in this area. Research
sponsors could play a role in the adoption of best practices in data security, by requiring researchers to implement appropriate security measures
prior to providing funding. In addition, the federal government should
support the development of technologies to enhance the security of health
information.
Examples of security standards and guidelines already exist in some
sectors, but they are not widely applied in health research. For instance, the
National Institute of Standards and Technology has developed standards
and guidance for the implementation of the Federal Information Security
Management Act of 2002, which was meant to bolster computer and network security within the federal government and affiliated parties (e.g.,
government contractors). These include standards for minimum security
requirements for information and information systems, as well as guidance
for assessing and selecting appropriate security controls for information systems, for determining security control effectiveness, and for certifying and
accrediting information systems (NIST, 2007). However, two recent GAO
reports found that although the federal government is improving information security performance, a number of significant information security
control deficiencies remain (GAO, 2008a,b). HHS, working through its
Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology,14
could play an important role in developing or adapting standards for health

research applications, and then encourage and facilitate broader use of such
standards in the health research community.
Potential Technical Approaches to
Health Data Privacy and Security
The security of data will continue to grow in importance as the health
care industry moves toward greater implementation of electronic health
records, and Congress has already proposed numerous bills to facilitate
and regulate that transition (see also Chapter 6). Advances in information
technology will likely make it easier to implement such measures as audit
trails and access controls in the future. Although the committee does not
recommend a specific technology solution, there are at least four technological approaches to enhancing data privacy and security that have been
proposed by others as having the potential to be particularly influential in
health research: (1) Privacy-preserving data mining and statistical disclosure limitation, (2) personal electronic health record devices, (3) independent consent management tools, and (4) pseudonymisation. Each seeks to
minimize or eliminate the transfer of personally identifiable data (Burkert,
2001). The advantages, limitations, and current feasibility of each are
described briefly below.
Privacy-preserving data mining and statistical disclosure limitation. In recent
years, a number of techniques have been proposed for modifying or transforming data in such a way so as to preserve privacy while statistically
analyzing the data (reviewed in Aggarwal and Yu, 2008; NRC, 2000, 2005,
2007b,c). Typically, such methods reduce the granularity of representation
in order to protect confidentiality. There is, however, a natural trade-off
between information loss and the confidentiality protection because this
reduction in granularity results in diminished accuracy and utility of the
data, and methods used in their analysis. Thus, a key issue is to maintain
maximum utility of the data without compromising the underlying privacy
constraints. In addition, there are a very large number of definitions of privacy and its protection in the statistical disclosure limitation and the privacypreserving data mining literatures, in part because of the varying goals.
Examples of statistical disclosure limitation and privacy-preserving data
mining methods include perturbation methods such as noise addition, which
attempts to mask the identifiable attributes of individual records, aggregation methods such as k-anonymity, which attempts to reduce the granularity
of representation of the data in such a way that a given record cannot be
distinguished from at least (k – 1) other records, the release of summary
statistics that can be used for actual statistical analyses such as marginal

totals from contingency tables, and various approaches to the generation of
synthetic data. Several of these are reviewed in Aggarwal and Yu (2008).
Other technologies include cryptographic methods for distributive privacy protection, which operate by allowing researchers to query various
databases online using cryptographic algorithms (Brands, 2007; reviewed in
Aggarwal and Yu, 2008), query auditing techniques, and output perturbation using methodology known as differential privacy (many of these techniques are reviewed in Aggarwal and Yu, 2008, and Dwork, 2008). These
technologies aim to protect privacy by minimizing the outflow of information to researchers, as the providers of the databases do not make any of the
actual data available to the researchers. The principal drawback of many
of these methods relates to the potentially limited utility of the released
information, especially for secondary analyses not planned in advance.
Each of the methods referred to above have strengths and weaknesses
for specific kinds of statistical analyses. Precisely how this body of developing methodologies may be effectively used in the types of health research
of the sort envisioned in this report remains an open question and this is
an area of active research. Thus, alternative mechanisms for data protection going beyond the removal of obvious identifiers and the application
of limited modifications of data elements are required. These mechanisms
need to be backed up by legal penalties and sanctions.
Personal electronic health record devices. The use of personal electronic
health record devices requires that all individuals possess a personal electronic device, such as a personal digital assistant (PDA) or personal computer, to manage their health information. The electronic device is intended
to be used by individuals to aggregate all of their health information into
one location (i.e., the electronic device). The infrastructure for implementing this privacy-enhancing technology exists, but there are several serious
problems with relying on this technology in health research. First, it is
unclear who would provide individuals with the devices, how they would
be maintained, and who would bear the cost of the maintenance. Second, it
is impossible for researchers to query every single individual for permission
to access his/her personal electronic health record device in order to determine if he/she meets the criteria for the relevant study. Only individuals
who are on the Internet and are involved in health research could easily be
queried. Third, the use of personal electronic devices would make it almost
impossible to aggregate data because of the difficulty of accessing data
from multiple sources. These problems are sufficiently serious that the use
of this technology is unlikely to offer a satisfactory solution to the privacy
and security concerns in health research (Brands, 2007).
Independent consent management tools. The independent consent manage-

102

BEYOND THE HIPAA PRIVACY RULE

ment tool (or infomediary) relies on a health trust to store all of an individual’s health data. When researchers are interested in accessing an individual’s
health information for a study, the researchers must contact the health trust.
The health trust will then approach the individual and asks whether he/she is
willing to give consent for the research. Examples of this technology include
Microsoft’s HealthVault, Google Health, and Revolution Health.
Independent consent management tools allow individuals to make
­blanket consents for their health information to be released for certain types
of researchers. For example, an individual can have a standing consent that
his/her information can be released to all researchers at the Mayo Clinic, or
for all research on cancer, etc. Thus, the use of a health trust allows an individual to have the power of consent for all uses of his/her health information, but does not require a specific consent in all instances (Brands, 2007).
Some privacy advocates are very favorable about the use of this technology
because they see it as a way to give patients complete control over who can
see and use their health information (PPR, 2008).
However, the use of this technology in health research has several
major problems. The first problem is that the health trust in this system
becomes a “honey pot” (i.e., the health trust holds ALL of an individual’s
data). This creates serious trust and security issues because a person’s entire
health record is stored in a single entity (Brands, 2007). A 2006 survey of
global financial services institutions found that respondents reported that
nearly 50 percent of all security breaches were a result of an internal failure
(e.g., a virus or worm originating inside the organization, insider fraud,
or ­inadvertent leakage of consumer data) (Melek and MacKinnon, 2006).
Many security breaches in health care are likely also a result of internal
failures. In addition, these organizations are currently not regulated by
the HIPAA Privacy Rule, so there are no legal federal privacy restrictions
preventing these entities from releasing individuals’ data to the government, marketing companies, or others, and no mandatory data security
requirements. New legislation or regulation making health trusts liable for
security breaches may be necessary before the public is willing to trust these
organizations to store personal health data (Metz, 2008).
The second major impediment to the widespread adoption of independent consent management tools is the difficulty of providing individuals
with secure online access to view their health information. The companies
marketing this technology need to develop a mechanism where indi­viduals
can access their medical information held by the health trust without
endangering its security and privacy. The current methods for individual
authentication online do not work well (NRC, 2003), but the use of a
strong authentication system in a single domain may solve this problem.
The companies will also need to address the fact that a significant portion
of the population does not have online access at all (Brands, 2007).

HEALTH INFORMATION PRIVACY

103

The final problem with using independent consent management systems
in health research is the inability to ensure the authenticity and integrity
of responses. There is no existing method for the health trusts to provide
the researchers with a guarantee that the information contained in their
database is accurate. If data are authenticated using existing methods, such
as through the use of digital signing, then it is impossible to truly protect
the privacy of the individuals’ information being disclosed (NRC, 2003).
­Cryptographic selective disclosure techniques may be able to solve this
problem, but the technology does not exist yet (Brands, 2007).
Pseudonymization. Pseudonymization is a method “used to replace the
true identities (nominative) of individuals or organizations in databases by
pseudo-identities (pseudo-IDs) that cannot be linked directly to their corresponding nominative identities” (Claerhout and De Moor, 2005). The
benefit of using pseudonymization in health research is that it protects individuals’ identities while allowing researchers to link personal data across
time and place by relying on the pseudo-IDs.
Most pseudonymization methods use a trusted third party to perform
the pseudonymization process. This results in at least three entities being
involved in the creation of each database. There is the data source that has
access to nominative personal data (e.g., PHI), the trusted third party, and
the data register that uses the pseudonymized data for research.
Two methods of pseudonymization are the batch data collection and
the interactive data collection. In the batch data collection, the data supplier splits the data into two parts: (1) the identifiers that relate to a specific
person (e.g., Social Security number, name), and (2) the payload data, which
includes all the nonidentifiable data associated with each individual. The
data are prepseudonymized at the data source and transferred to the trusted
third party, which converts the prepseudonyms data into a final pseudo-ID.
Both the final pseudo-ID and payload data are transferred to the data register, where they are stored and used for research; no data are stored with the
trusted third party. Privacy concerns are minimized because the only version
of the data that is available to researchers is pseudonymized data.
The interactive data collection is used in situations where neither
the data supplier nor the data register has a need for local storage of the
data. All the data is stored by a trusted third party in pseudonymous
form. Both the data supplier and the data register must query the trusted
third party to access the data (Claerhout and De Moor, 2005; De Moor
et al., 2003).
It is unclear how technologies relying on pseudonymization would be
implemented under the requirements of the HIPAA Privacy Rule. In order
for information to be considered deidentified, the HIPAA Privacy Rule
specifically states that covered entities can assign a code or other means of

104

BEYOND THE HIPAA PRIVACY RULE

record identification (such as a pseudo-ID), but the code cannot be derived
from, or related to, information about the subject of the information.15 This
means that any pseudo-IDs created using this technology must be based
entirely on nonpersonal information. Alternatively, any researchers using
the pseudonymized data must go through the normal IRB/Privacy Board
review process.
Conclusions AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on its review of the information described in this chapter, the
committee agreed on an overarching principle to guide the formation of
recommendations. The committee affirms the importance of maintaining
and improving the privacy of health information. In the context of health
research, privacy includes the commitment to handle personal information
of patients and research participants with meaningful privacy protections,
including strong security measures, transparency, and accountability.16
These commitments extend to everyone who collects, uses, or has access
to personally identifiable health information of patients and research participants. Practices of security, transparency, and accountability take on
extraordinary importance in the health research setting: Researchers and
other data users should disclose clearly how and why personal information is being collected, used, and secured, and should be subject to legally
enforceable obligations to ensure that personally identifiable information
is used appropriately and securely. In this manner, privacy protection will
help to ensure research participation and public trust and confidence in
medical research.
As part of the process of implementing this principle into the federal
oversight regime of health research, the committee recommends that all
institutions in the health research community that are involved in the collection, use, and disclosure of personally identifiable health information
should take strong measures to safeguard the security of health data. For
example, institutions could:
•
•
•

Appoint a security officer responsible for assessing data protection
needs and implementing solutions and staff training.
Make greater use of encryption and other techniques for data
security.
Include data security experts on IRBs.

105

Implement a breach notification requirement, so that patients may
take steps to protect their identity in the event of a breach.
Implement layers of security protection to eliminate single points
of vulnerability to security breaches.

In addition, the federal government should support the development
and use of:
•
•

Genuine privacy-enhancing techniques that minimize or eliminate
the collection of personally identifiable data.
Standardized self-evaluations and security audits and certification
programs to help institutions achieve the goal of safeguarding the
security of personal health data.

Effective health privacy protections require effective data security measures. The HIPAA Security Rule (which entails a set of regulatory provisions
separate from the Privacy Rule) already sets a floor for data security standards within covered entities, but not all institutions that conduct health
research are subject to HIPAA regulations. Also, the survey data presented
in this chapter show that neither the HIPAA Privacy Rule nor the HIPAA
Security Rule have directly improved public confidence that personal health
information will be kept confidential. Therefore, all institutions conducting
health research should undertake measures to strengthen data protections.
For example, given the recent spate of lost or stolen laptops containing
patient health information, encryption should be required for all laptops
and removable media containing such data. However, in general, given the
differences among the missions and activities of institutions in the health
research community, some flexibility in the implementation of specific security measures will be necessary.
Enhanced security would reduce the risk of data theft and reinforce
the public’s trust in the research community by diminishing anxiety about
the potential for unintentional disclosure of information. The publication
of best practices and outreach to all stakeholders by HHS, combined with
a cooperative approach to compliance with security standards, such as
self-evaluation and audit programs, would promote progress in this area.
Research sponsors could also play a roll in fostering the adoption of best
practices in data security.

The Value, Importance, and
Oversight of Health Research

The previous chapter reviewed the value of privacy, while this chapter
examines the value and importance of health research. As noted in the
introduction to Chapter 2, the committee views privacy and health research
as complementary values. Ideally, society should strive to facilitate both for
the benefit of individuals as well as the public.
In addition to defining health research and delineating its value to
individuals and society, this chapter provides an overview and historical
perspective of federal research regulations that were in place long before
the Privacy Rule was implemented. Because a great deal of medical research
falls under the purview of multiple federal regulations, it is important to
understand how the various rules overlap or diverge. The chapter also
explains how the definition of research has become quite complex under
the various federal regulations, which make a distinction between research
and some closely related health practice activities that also use health data,
such as quality improvement initiatives.
The chapter also reviews the available survey data regarding public
perceptions of health research and describes the importance of effective
communication about health research with patients and the public.
Concepts and Value of Health Research
Definitions
Under both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
(HIPAA) Privacy Rule and the Common Rule, “research” is defined as “a

systematic investigation, including research development, testing and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge.” This
is a broad definition that may include biomedical research, epidemiological studies, and health services research, as well as studies of behavioral,
social, and economic factors that affect health.
Perhaps the most familiar form of health research is the clinical trial,
in which patients volunteer to participate in studies to test the efficacy and
safety of new medical interventions. But an increasingly large portion of
health research is now information based. A great deal of research entails
the analysis of data and biological samples that were initially collected for
diagnostic, treatment, or billing purposes, or that were collected as part of
other research projects, and are now being used for new research purposes.
This secondary use of data is a common research approach in fields such
as epidemiology, health services research, and public health research, and
includes analysis of patterns of occurrences, determinants, and natural history of disease; evaluation of health care interventions and services; drug
safety surveillance; and some genetic and social studies (Lowrance, 2002;
Lowrance and Collins, 2007).
The Importance of Health Research
Like privacy, health research has high value to society. It can provide
important information about disease trends and risk factors, outcomes of
treatment or public health interventions, functional abilities, patterns of
care, and health care costs and use. The different approaches to research
provide complementary insights. Clinical trials can provide important information about the efficacy and adverse effects of medical interventions by
controlling the variables that could impact the results of the study, but
feedback from real-world clinical experience is also crucial for comparing
and improving the use of drugs, vaccines, medical devices, and diagnostics.
For example, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of a drug for
a particular indication is based on a series of controlled clinical trials, often
 Epidemiology is the study of the occurrence, distribution, and control of diseases in
populations.
 Health services research has been defined as a multidisciplinary field of inquiry, both
basic and applied, that examines the use, costs, quality, accessibility, delivery, organization,
financing, and outcomes of health care services to increase knowledge and understanding of
the structure, processes, and effects of health services for individuals and populations (IOM,
1995).
 The National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics has noted that “secondary uses”
of health data is an ill-defined term, and urges abandoning it in favor of precise description
of each use (NCVHS, 2007a). Thus, the committee chose to minimize use of the term in this
report.

with a few hundred to a few thousand patients, but after approval it may be
used by millions of people in many different contexts. Therefore, tracking
clinical experience with the drug is important for identifying relatively rare
adverse effects and for determining the effectiveness in different populations
or in various circumstances. It is also vital to record and assess experience
in clinical practice in order to develop guidelines for best practices and to
ensure high-quality patient care.
Collectively, these forms of health research have led to significant
discoveries, the development of new therapies, and a remarkable improvement in health care and public health. Economists have found that medical research can have an enormous impact on human health and longevity,
and that the resulting increased productivity of the population contributes
greatly to the national economy (Hatfield et al., 2001; Murphy and Topel,
1999) in addition to the individual benefits of improved health. If the
research enterprise is impeded, or if it is less robust, important ­ societal
interests are affected.
The development of Herceptin as a treatment for breast cancer is a
prime example of the benefits of research using biological samples and
patient records (Box 3-1) (Slamon et al., 1987). Many other examples of
findings from medical records research have changed the practice of medicine as well. Such research underlies the estimate that tens of thousands of
Americans die each year from medical errors in the hospital, and research
has provided valuable information for reducing these medical errors by
implementing health information technology, such as e-­prescribing (Bates
et al., 1998; IOM, 2000b). This type of research also has documented that
disparities in health care and lack of access to care in inner cities and rural
areas result in poorer health outcomes (Mick et al., 1994). Furthermore,
medical records research has demonstrated that preventive services (e.g.,
mammography) substantially reduce mortality and morbidity at reasonable
costs (Mandelblatt et al., 2003), and has established a causal link between
the nursing shortage and patient health outcomes by documenting that
patients in hospitals with fewer registered nurses are hospitalized longer
and are more likely to suffer complications, such as urinary tract infections
and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (Needleman et al., 2002). These findings have all informed and influenced policy decisions at the national level.
As the use of electronic medical records increases, the pace of this form of
research is accelerating, and the opportunities to generate new knowledge
about what works in health care are expanding (CHSR, 2008).

Examples of Important Findings from
Medical Database Research
Herceptin and breast cancer: Data were collected from a cohort of more than
9,000 breast cancer patients whose tumor specimens were consecutively received
at the University of San Antonio (1974–1992, from across the United States). Data
were collected prospectively with audits for verification, and recurrences were
recorded through systematic patient follow-up. This database was analyzed to
identify prognostic factors, and the results showed that amplification of the HER-2
oncogene was a significant predictor of both overall survival and time to relapse in
patients with breast cancer. This information subsequently led to the development
of Herceptin (trastuzumab), a targeted therapy that is effective for many women
with HER-2–positive breast cancer.
Folic acid and birth defects: Medical records research led to the discovery that
supplementing folic acid during pregnancy can prevent neural tube birth defects
(NTDs). Studies in the 1970s found that vitamin (folate) deficiency and use of
anticonvulsive drugs that deplete folate were associated with higher rates of
NTDs, and studies in the 1980s found that use of folate supplements was associated with decreased rates. Population-based surveillance systems showed that
the number of NTDs decreased 31 percent after mandatory fortification of cereal
grain products.
Effects of intrauterine DES exposure: Starting in the 1940s, diethylstilbestrol
(DES) was used by millions of pregnant women to prevent miscarriages and other
disorders in pregnancy. In the 1970s, retrospective studies of medical records
began to show that infants exposed to DES during the first trimester of pregnancy
had an increased risk as adults of breast, vaginal, and cervical cancer as well as
reproductive anomalies. In November 1971, the FDA sent a FDA Drug Bulletin
to all U.S. physicians advising them to stop prescribing DES to pregnant women
and ordered that prevention of miscarriage be removed from Indications and
pregnancy be added to Contraindications in the physician-prescribing information
for DES.
Patient safety: Health services research estimated that tens of thousands of
­Americans die each year from medical errors in the hospital. A 1998 study led by
David Bates (Brigham & Women’s Hospital) found that computerized order entry
of prescriptions at Brigham & Women’s Hospital reduced medical error rates by
55 percent; rates of serious errors fell by 86 percent. In response to this groundbreaking work, hospitals around the country are installing their own computerized physician order entry systems. For example, The Leapfrog Group—a large
national coalition of more than 100 public and private organizations that provide
health care benefits—includes computerized physician order entry as one of the
safety standards it encourages hospitals to adopt.

Mortality risks of antipsychotic drugs in the elderly: In 2005, the FDA issued
a public health advisory stating that the atypical (second generation) antipsychotic
medications increase mortality among elderly patients. This decision was based
on the results of 17 placebo-controlled trials with such drugs that enrolled a total
of 5,106 elderly patients with dementia who had behavioral disorders. Fifteen of
the studies showed numerical increases in mortality in the drug-treated group
compared to the placebo-treated patients (approximately 1.6-1.7–fold increase
in mortality), most often due to heart-related events (e.g., heart failure, sudden
death) or infections (mostly pneumonia). However, the risk of death with older,
conventional agents was not known. Results from two subsequent retrospective
reviews of 27,000 and 37,000 medical records of elderly patients who had been
treated with either conventional or atypical antipsychotic drugs indicated that
conventional antipsychotic medications are at least as likely as atypical agents to
increase the risk of death among those patients. As a result, the FDA now requires
that the prescribing information for all antipsychotic drugs includes the same information about this risk in a boxed warning and a warnings section.
Child safety: Using the Partners for Child Passenger Safety (PCPS)—an ongoing
child-focused, real-time, crash surveillance system established with the State Farm
Insurance Companies in 1997—Flaura Winston (Children’s Hospital of ­Pennsylvania)
found that only 25 percent of children between 3 and 7 years of age were appropriately restrained in crashes; children in seat belts alone were at a 3.5-fold increased
risk of serious injury. Winston’s analysis of PCPS data led to the rapid adoption of
belt-positioning boosters as the appropriate form of restraint for children once they
have outgrown car seats. Appropriate restraint by children in this age group has
doubled, and child fatality from crashes is at its lowest level ever.
Obesity: Eric Finkelstein (RTI International) used data from the late 1990s to find
that obesity is responsible for up to $92.6 billion in medical expenditures each
year; approximately half of obesity-related health care costs are borne by Medicare and Medicaid. A 2002 study by Roland Sturm (RAND) found that the effects
of obesity on a number of chronic conditions were larger than those of smoking
or problem drinking. Since then, obesity has been escalated to the top of the list
of health care priorities, and policy makers have appropriated funds for federal
agencies to fund health services research that encourages people to understand
the effects of diet and exercise on their health.
Rural health: Stephen Mick (Virginia Commonwealth University) and colleagues
examined rural hospital performance in the late 1980s and early 1990s and found
that activity typical of urban hospitals is beyond the capacity of most rural facilities
and recommended that a new federal approach would be required to preserve
rural acute-care services. This work helped form the intellectual basis for Medicare’s highly successful Critical Access Hospital program, which was designed to
improve rural health care access and reduce closures of hospitals that provide
essential community services.

Workforce and health outcomes: In 1997, Jack Needleman (University of
California–Los Angeles) and Peter Buerhaus (Vanderbilt University) analyzed
more than 6 million patient discharge records from 799 hospitals in 11 states. They
found that patients in hospitals with fewer registered nurses stay hospitalized longer and are more likely to suffer complications, such as urinary tract infections and
upper gastrointestinal bleeding. This research established a causal link between
the nursing shortage and outcomes, and helped move the nursing shortage into
the public’s eye and onto policy makers’ radar. In 2002, Congress passed the
Nurse Reinvestment Act to increase the domestic supply of nurses.

Advances in health information technology are enabling a transformation in health research that could facilitate studies that were not feasible
in the past, and thus lead to new insights regarding health and disease. As
noted by the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics, “Clinically
rich information is now more readily available, in a more structured format,
and able to be electronically exchanged throughout the health and health
care continuum. As a result, the information can be better used for quality
improvement, public health, and research, and can significantly contribute
to improvements in health and health care for individuals and populations”
(NCVHS, 2007a). The informatics grid recently developed with support
from the National Cancer Institute (Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid,
or caBIG) is an example of a how information technologies can facilitate
health research by enabling broader sharing of health data while still ensuring regulatory compliance and protecting patient privacy (Box 3-2).
Science today is also changing rapidly and becoming more complex, so
no single researcher or single site can bring all the expertise to develop and
validate medical innovations or to ensure their safety. Thus, efficient sharing of information between institutions has become even more important
than in previous eras, when there were fewer new therapies introduced. The
expansion of treatment options, as well as the escalating expense of new
therapies, mandates greater scrutiny of true effectiveness, once efficacy
 Effectiveness can be defined as the extent to which a specific test or intervention, when used

under ordinary circumstances, does what it is intended to do. Efficacy refers to the extent to
which a specific test or intervention produces a beneficial result under ideal conditions (e.g.,
in a clinical trial).

caBIG (Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid)
The National Cancer Institute’s caBIG Data Sharing and Intellectual Capital
Workspace’s mission is to enable all constituencies in the cancer community—
including researchers, physicians, and patients—to share data and knowledge
through an informatics grid “by addressing the legal, regulatory, ethical, policy,
academic, proprietary, and contractual barriers.”
The caBIG strives to achieve this objective through a number of different
initiatives. First, caBIG provides decision support tools for institutions that share
data through the informatics grid. This analytic framework is intended to encourage institutions to make consistent analysis of legal, regulatory, and ethical constraints on data sharing. The program has identified four sets of considerations
for institutions to analyze: (1) intellectual property considerations, (2) privacy and
confidentiality considerations, (3) IRB and ethical considerations, and (4) sponsor
considerations.
Second, caBIG has identified a number of best practices and processes for
facilitating the approval of data sharing agreements via the caBIG infrastructure.
Currently identified best practices include suggestions for conducting the patient
informed consent process in a manner that permits data to be shared via caBIG,
standardizing expectations for sharing unpublished data, creating recommendations for developing contract clauses for sponsored research projects that permit
broad data sharing, and providing information documents for IRBs and Privacy
Boards to use in reviewing proposals for data sharing via caBIG.
Third, caBIG has created model documents intended to facilitate and expedite the arrangements between institutions to share data. These include model
informed consent provisions, model researcher questionnaires and data sharing checklists, and security-related agreements. Finally, caBIG has developed
security policies and requirements for systems that are attached to or access the
caBIG infrastructure.
Under caBIG, each institution retains legal responsibility for the research data
it generates; this includes responsibility for complying with the HIPAA Privacy
Rule, the Common Rule, as well as any applicable state laws. The institutions
also retain the right to determine who they will share their data with, what type of
data (deidentified versus identifiable) they will share and under what terms and
conditions. The advantage to conducting research within the caBIG technical
infrastructure is that the program has identified the common legal and ethical
considerations that apply to all researchers across the country, and has simplified
the process for sharing data. In addition, the caBIG infrastructure has increased
institutions’ trust in one another because “everyone is playing by the same rules”
and a common set of expectations exist. Recently, the BIG Health Consortium
was developed to extend the concept of caBIG beyond cancer research, and to
link all stakeholders in biomedicine through a new biomedical configuration.

has been demonstrated. This requires registries of patient characteristics,
outcomes, and adverse events. Large populations are required to facilitate comparison of patient populations and to calculate risk/benefit estimates. For example, INTERMACS (Interagency Registry for Mechanically
Assisted Circulatory Support) is a national registry for patients who are
receiving mechanical circulatory support device therapy to treat advanced
heart failure. This registry was devised as a joint effort of the National
Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, FDA, clinicians, scientists and industry representatives. Analysis of
the data collected is expected to facilitate improved patient evaluation and
management while aiding in better device development. Registry results are
also expected to influence future research and facilitate appropriate regulation and reimbursement of such devices. Similarly, the Extracorporeal Life
Support Organization (ELSO), an international consortium of health care
professionals and scientists who focus on the development and evaluation
of novel therapies for support of failing organ systems, maintains a registry
of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and other novel forms of organ
system support. Registry data are used to support clinical practice and
research, as well as regulatory agencies. Another example is the database
developed by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) for the collection, storage, analysis and publication of data pertaining to the patient
waiting list, organ matching, and transplants. Launched in 1999, this
secure Internet-based system contains data regarding every organ donation
and transplant event occurring in the United States since 1986.
Information-based research, such as research using health information
databases has many advantages (reviewed by Lowrance, 2002). It is often
faster and less expensive than experimental studies; it can analyze very large
sets of data and may detect unexpected phenomena or differences among
subpopulations that might not be included in a controlled experimental
study; it can often be undertaken when controlled trials are simply not
possible for ethical, technical, or other reasons, and it can be used to study
effectiveness of a specific test or intervention in clinical practice, rather than
just the efficacy as determined by a controlled experimental study. It can
also reexamine data accrued in other research studies, such as clinical trials,
to answer new questions quickly and inexpensively. However, informationbased research does have limitations. Often it has less statistical rigor than
controlled clinical studies because it lacks scientific control over the original
data collection, quality, and format that prospective experimental research
can dictate from the start. In addition to these scientific limitations, because

of its relational and often distant physical separation from the data subjects,
and the sheer volume of the records involved, obtaining individual consent
for the research can be difficult or impossible.
Advances in information-based medical research could also facilitate the
movement toward personalized medicine, which will make health research
more meaningful to individuals. The goal of personalized medicine is to
tailor prevention strategies and treatments to each individual based on
his/her genetic composition and health history. In spite of the strides made
in improving health through new treatments, it is widely known that most
drugs are effective in only a fraction of patients who have the condition
for which the drug is indicated. Moreover, a small percentage of patients
are likely to have adverse reactions to drugs that are found to be safe for
the majority of the population at the recommended dose. Both of these
phenomena are due to variability in the patient population. Revolutionary
advances in the study of genetics and other markers of health and disease
are now making it possible to identify and study these variations, and are
leading to more personalized approaches to health care—that is, the ability
to give “the appropriate drug, at the appropriate dose, to the appropriate patient, at the appropriate time.” Achieving the goals of personalized
medicine will lead to improvements in both the effectiveness and the safety
of medical therapies.
Public Perceptions of Health Research
A number of studies have been undertaken to gauge the public’s attitude toward research and the factors that influence individuals’ willingness
to participate in research. The surveys reviewed in this chapter focus on
interventional clinical trials. A review of survey questions to gauge the
public willingness to allow their medical records to be used in research can
be found in Chapter 2.
The Public Values Health Research
A number of studies suggest that most Americans have a positive view
of medical research and believe that research is beneficial to society. A
recent Harris poll found that nearly 80 percent of respondents were interested in health research findings, consistent with previous survey results
(Westin, 2007). A study in 2005 compiled data from 70 state surveys and
18 national surveys and found that the majority of Americans believe maintaining world leadership in health-related research is important. ­ Seventyeight percent of respondents said that it is very important, and 17 percent
said that it is somewhat important. Only 4 percent of Americans reported
that maintaining world leadership in health-related research is not impor-

tant (Woolley and Propst, 2005). Similar results were found in a 2007
survey—76 percent of respondents reported that science plays a very important role in our health, and 78 percent reported that science plays a very
important role in our competitiveness (Research!America, 2007).
The Virginia Commonwealth University 2004 Life Sciences Survey also
found that most Americans have a positive view of research. In this study,
90 percent of respondents agreed that developments in science have made
society better; 92 percent reported that “scientific research is essential for
improving the quality of human lives”; and 84 percent agreed that “the
benefits of scientific research outweigh the harmful results” (NSF, 2006).
Overall Experience When Participating in Research
Little is known about the attitudes of individuals who have actually
participated in medical research. However, the available evidence suggests
that most research participants have positive experiences. A recent Harris
Poll found that 13 percent of respondents had participated in some form
of health research, and 87 percent of those felt comfortable about their
experience (Westin, 2007). In a study focused on cancer, 93 percent of
respondents who participated in research reported it as a very positive experience; 76 percent said they would recommend participation in a clinical
trial to someone with cancer. Most physicians surveyed in this study stated
that they believe clinical trial participants receive the best possible care,
and have outcomes at least as good as patients receiving standard cancer
treatment (Comis et al., 2000). Another study found that 55 percent of individuals who participated in a research study would be willing to participate
again in a future research study (Trauth et al., 2000).
Willingness to Participate in Research
Public opinion surveys indicate that a majority of Americans are
willing to participate in clinical research studies. In 2001, a compilation
of studies commissioned by Research!America found that 63 percent of
Americans would be willing to participate in a clinical research study
­(Woolley and Propst, 2005). This percentage has remained stable over
time. A 2007 Research!America survey also found that 63 percent of
Americans would be very likely to participate in a clinical research study
if asked (Research!America, 2007); 68 percent of respondents reported
that their desire to improve their own health or the health of others was a
major factor in deciding whether to participate in a clinical research project
(Research!America, 2007).
Other surveys also suggest that willingness to participate in research
focused on specific diseases is quite high. In one survey, the percentage of

respondents indicating a willingness to participate in a medical research
study was 88 percent for cancer, 86 percent for heart disease, 83 percent for
a noncurable fatal disease, 79 percent for addiction, 78 percent for depression, and 76 percent for schizophrenia (Trauth et al., 2000). Respondents
with greater knowledge of how research is conducted were more willing to
participate (Trauth et al., 2000). Another study found that 8 of 10 Americans would consider participating in a clinical trial if faced with cancer.
More than two-thirds of respondents said they would be willing to participate in a clinical trial designed to prevent cancer (Comis et al., 2000).
Americans also seem to be very supportive of medical research that
relies on genetic data. A 2007 survey found that 93 percent of Americans
supported the use of genetic testing if the information collected is used by
researchers to find new ways to diagnose, prevent, or treat disease (Genetics
& Public Policy Center, 2007). Two separate surveys found that 66 percent
of Americans would be willing to donate their genetic material for medical
research (Genetics & Public Policy Center, 2007; Research!America, 2007).
However, despite this apparent positive view of genetic research, 92 percent
of Americans reported they were concerned about their genetic information
being used in a “harmful way” (Genetics & Public Policy Center, 2007).
Many factors, in addition to concerns about privacy and confidentiality (Genetics & Public Policy Center, 2007; Research!America, 2007), may
influence an individual’s willingness to participate in a medical research
study. The Trauth survey found that individuals with higher income levels,
with a college or graduate degree, or with children were more likely to
participate in research. Age affected willingness to participate: 57 percent of
respondents ages 18–34 were willing to participate in research, but only 31
percent of respondents ages 65 or older were willing (Trauth et al., 2000).
Other factors that potentially influence an individual’s willingness to
participate in research are race and ethnicity. It is well documented that
minorities participate in health research at a much lower percentage than
white Americans. Many cultural, linguistic, and socioeconomic barriers
could be responsible for this difference (Giuliano et al., 2000), and study
results have been variable on this issue. Several studies suggest that the low
participation rates by racial and ethnic minority groups are due to their
strong distrust of the medical research community compared to the general
population (Braunstein et al., 2008; Corbie-Smith et al., 1999; Farmer et
al., 2007; Grady et al., 2006; Shavers et al., 2002).
However, other evidence suggests that the low percentage of minorities
participating in research is related to minority groups’ lack of access to the
research community (Brown et al., 2000; Wendler et al., 2006; Williams
and Corbie-Smith, 2006). Thus, it is likely that the low number of minority
individuals participating in medical research is at least partly due to recruitment techniques that are ineffective for minority populations.

BEYOND THE HIPAA PRIVACY RULE

The survey that focused on cancer research suggests that one of the
main reasons why individuals do not participate in research is lack of
knowledge about the availability of clinical trials. In a survey of nearly
6,000 cancer patients, 85 percent said they were unaware of the opportunity to participate in a clinical trial. Respondents who did participate said
they did so because of one of the following beliefs: (1) trials provide access
to the best quality of care (76 percent), (2) their participation would benefit
future cancer patients (72 percent), (3) they would receive newer and better
treatment (63 percent), and (4) participation would get them more care and
attention (40 percent) (Comis et al., 2000).
A recommendation from a physician can also impact participation. In
the United States, 48 percent of respondents to one survey reported that a
physicians’ recommendation would be a major factor in deciding whether
to take part in a research study. Nearly three-fourths of respondents also
cited an institution’s reputation as a key factor to consider when deciding
whether to participate in a study (Research!America, 2007). Twenty percent
of respondents in an Italian public survey indicated that the presence of a
physician as a reference during a research study influenced their willingness
to participate (Mosconi et al., 2005).
In sum, surveys indicate that the vast majority of Americans have a
positive view of medical research, believe that research is beneficial to society, and are interested in health research findings. Although little is known
about the attitudes of individuals who have actually participated in medical
research, the available evidence suggests that most research participants
have positive experiences. Surveys also suggest that a majority of Americans
are willing to participate in clinical research studies. Similar to the findings
in Chapter 2, surveys indicate that many factors, in addition to concerns
about privacy and confidentiality, can potentially influence an individual’s
willingness to participate in medical research, including the type of research
and personal characteristics such as health status, age, education, and race.
Notably, respondents with greater knowledge of how research is conducted
were more willing to participate in research.
OVERSIGHT OF HEALTH RESEARCH
Historical Development of Federal Protections
of Health Information in Research
The development of international codes, federal legislation, and federal
regulation of human subjects often occurred in response to past abuses in
biomedical experiments (reviewed by Pritts, 2008) (Box 3-3). The most
well-known examples included (1) reported abuses of concentration camp
prisoners in Nazi experiments during World War II, and (2) the Tuskegee

syphilis study begun in 1932, in which researchers withheld effective treatment from affected African American men long after a cure for syphilis was
found. Most of the current principles and standards for conducting human
subjects research were developed primarily to protect against the physical
and mental harms that can result from these types of biomedical experiments. Therefore, they focus on the principles of autonomy and consent.
Although the standards apply to research that uses identifiable health information, research based solely on information is not their primary focus.
In the United States, perhaps the most influential inquiry into the protection of human subjects in research was the Belmont Report. The Belmont
principles have been elaborated on in many settings, and served as the basis
for formal regulation of human subjects research in the United States. In
general, states do not directly regulate the activity of most researchers
(Burris et al., 2003). However, the Belmont Commission’s recommendations
were reflected in the Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS’s)
Policy for Protection of Human Subjects Research, Subpart A of 45 C.F.R.
46 (“Subpart A”) in 1979. These protections were considered a benchmark policy for federal agencies, and in December 1981, the President’s
Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical
and Behavioral Research recommended10 that all federal departments and
agencies adopt the HHS regulations.11
In 1982, the President’s Office of Science and Technology Policy
appointed a Committee for the Protection of Human Research Subjects
to respond to the recommendations of the President’s commission. The
committee agreed that uniformity of federal regulations on human subjects
protection is desirable to eliminate unnecessary regulations and to promote
increased understanding by institutions that conduct federally supported
or regulated research. As a result, in 1991, other federal departments and
agencies joined HHS in adopting a uniform set of rules for the protection of
human subjects of research, identical to Subpart A of 45 C.F.R. 46, which
is now informally known as the “Common Rule.” Eighteen federal agencies
have now adopted the Common Rule as their own respective regulations.

on human beings and aims to ensure that the rights of human subjects

The Basis for Human Subjects Protections
in Biomedical Research
Nuremberg Code
The Nuremberg Code, created by the international community after the Nazi
War Crimes Trials, is generally seen as the first codification of ethical norms
governing experimentation on humans. Although it did not carry the force of law,
the Nuremberg Code was the first international document to advocate voluntary
participation and informed consent, which is partially based on autonomy. The
Code established a set of ethical standards for physical experiments on humans
emphasizing the following principles:
•
•
•

The need to obtain the informed consent of the research subject;
The duty to avoid all unnecessary physical and mental suffering and injury;
and
The requirement that any and all risks associated with the research must be
outweighed by associated benefits.
Declaration of Helsinki

In 1964, The World Medical Association adopted the “Ethical Principles for
Medical Research Involving Human Subjects,” also known as the “Declaration of
Helsinki,” noting that all “[m]edical research is subject to ethical standards that
promote respect for all human beings and protect their health and rights.” The
Declaration, which sets forth ethical principles to provide guidance to investigators and participants in human subjects research, made expressly clear that
ethical standards on medical research encompass the protection of research on
identifiable human material or identifiable data. The Declaration reiterated the
principles of informed consent found in the Nuremberg Code and amplified them
by, among other things, requiring that all experimental research be reviewed by
an independent body. The principles are based on the general concept that it is
the duty of medical researchers “to protect the life, health, privacy, and dignity
of the human subject.” The principles also require that “[e]very precaution [is
made] . . . to respect the privacy of the subject, the confidentiality of the patient’s
information and to minimize the impact of the study on the subject’s physical and
mental integrity and on the personality of the subject.” Thus, the Helsinki Declaration promotes the concepts of respect, autonomy, privacy, and confidentiality.

stresses the importance of individual autonomy and consent; requires independent review of research by an Institutional Review Board (IRB); and
seeks to minimize physical and mental harm. Privacy and confidentiality

Belmont Report
In 1979, the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of
Biomedical and Behavioral Research, created largely in response to the ethical
breaches of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, issued the “Belmont Report” to guide
the resolution of ethical problems arising from research involving human subjects.
The report first distinguished between practice (interventions designed solely to
enhance the well-being of a patient) and research (activities intended to test a
hypothesis and gain generalizable knowledge) and concluded that when elements
of research are present in an activity, that activity should undergo review for the
protection of human subjects. The Commission then identified and defined three
overarching principles applicable to research involving human subjects: respect
for persons, beneficence, and justice. Two of these principles, respect for persons
and beneficence, are particularly relevant to privacy. The principle of respect for
persons encompasses the requirement to treat competent adults as autonomous
individuals capable of making their own choices. In application, this requires that
subjects, to the degree that they are capable, be given the opportunity to choose
what will or will not happen to them. Informed consent is closely tied to the principle of respect for persons because it provides information about potential benefits
and risks, including how personal data will be protected, and requires comprehension of those risks and voluntariness to participate. The principle of respect for
persons also seeks to protect persons with diminished autonomy, such as children
and persons with serious mental disabilities. The principle of beneficence consists
of the obligations to not harm the subject and to maximize possible benefits and
minimize possible harms. Such an assessment should consider not only physical
and psychological harms, but also social and economic harms, including breach
of privacy. These harms are to be weighed against the anticipated benefit to the
subject (if any) and the anticipated benefit to society. Although not as salient to
questions of privacy and research, the third Belmont principle of justice is also
worth emphasizing. Justice requires that the benefits and burdens of human
subjects research be fairly allocated. It therefore protects the least advantaged in
society.

protections, although not defined in a detailed and prescriptive manner, are
included as important components of risk in research.
The framework for achieving the goal of protecting human subjects
is based on two foundational requirements: the informed consent of the

research participant and the review of proposed research by an IRB.
This section describes some of the basic parameters of the Common Rule
(reviewed by Pritts, 2008). Particular provisions that interact with the
HIPAA Privacy Rule are described in more detail in Chapter 4.
Scope of the Common Rule
In general, the Common Rule applies only to research on human
subjects that is supported by the federal government.12 As noted previously, research is defined as “a systematic investigation, including research
development, testing, and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to
generalizable knowledge.”13
Under the Common Rule, a “human subject” is defined as “a living
individual about whom an investigator . . . conducting research obtains (1)
Data through intervention or interaction with the individual, or (2) Identifiable private information.” Private information is considered to be personally
identifiable if the identity of the subject is or may readily be ascertained by
the investigator or associated with the information.
The Common Rule applies to most human subjects research conducted
using federal funds, but its influence is broader because most institutions
that accept federal funds sign an agreement (a Federalwide Assurance
or FWA) with HHS to abide by the Common Rule requirements in all
research, regardless of funding source. Nonetheless, some privately funded
human subjects research is conducted outside the purview of federal regulation (Goldman and Choy, 2001; Williams, 2005). Companies and other
organizations may voluntarily choose to apply the Common Rule to their
research projects, and many do. However, research projects in which compliance is voluntary are not subject to oversight or disciplinary action by
HHS (Goldman and Choy, 2001; Williams, 2005).
Informed Consent14
The Common Rule requires that a researcher obtain informed consent
(usually in writing) from a person before he/she can be admitted to a study
(Williams, 2005). Informed consent is sought through a process in which
a person learns key facts about a research study, including the potential
risks and benefits, so that he/she can then agree voluntarily to take part or
decide against it.
12 See 45 C.F.R. § 46.101 (2005).
13 See 45 C.F.R. § 46.102(d) (2005).
14 This section on informed consent is based largely on a Congressional Research Service

report (Williams, 2005), as adapted by Pritts (2008).

127

The Common Rule informed consent regulations focus primarily on the
elements and documentation of informed consent rather than on the process
used to obtain it. As to the process, the regulations require that informed
consent be sought only under circumstances that provide the prospective
subject with adequate opportunity to consider whether to participate. The
Common Rule requires that information pertaining to informed consent
be given in language understandable to the subject, and that the consent
does not imply that the subject is giving up his/her legal rights or that the
investigator is released from liability for negligence during the conduct of
the study.15
The Common Rule also specifies a number of elements that must be
provided when informed consent is sought. These elements include:
•
•
•
•
•
•

an explanation of the purposes of the research,
the expected duration of the subject’s participation,
the potential risks and benefits of the research,
how confidentiality will be maintained,
the fact that participation is strictly voluntary, and
who the subject can contact to answer questions about the study
or about his/her rights as a research participant.

In certain limited circumstances, the Common Rule allows an informed
consent to be for unspecified future research. For example, under the Common Rule an informed consent can be used to obtain a person’s permission
to study personally identifiable information maintained in a repository for
future, unspecified research purposes (HHS, 2003).
For the most part, the required elements of an informed consent
address all types of research, although some are more relevant to biomedical research (e.g., the consent must include a disclosure of appropriate alternative procedures or courses of treatment, if any, that might be
advantageous to the subject). One required element of informed consent
is particularly relevant to research involving personally identifiable health
information. The Common Rule requires an informed consent to include a
statement describing the extent, if any, to which confidentiality of records
identifying the subject will be maintained.16
Institutional Review Boards
Adopting the principles of the Belmont Report, the Common Rule
requires that protocols for human subjects research be reviewed by an IRB
15 See 45 C.F.R. § 46.116 (2005).

(Box 3-4) before research may begin.17 The IRB must meet certain membership requirements, including having members with different expertise and
at least one member who is not affiliated with the investigator’s institution.
The Common Rule specifies which level of IRB review is needed for various types of research and provides criteria for the IRB to consider during
the review. Although the Common Rule does not specify the procedures
an IRB must follow in its review of protocols, it does require the IRB to
have written procedures for how it will review protocols and document
IRB decisions.
The Common Rule requires that an IRB determine the following factors
are satisfied to approve proposed research:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Risks to subjects are minimized;
Risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits,
if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may
reasonably be expected to result;
The selection of subjects is equitable;
Informed consent will be sought in accordance with the rules and
will be documented;
When appropriate, the research plan makes adequate provision for
monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects; and
When appropriate, adequate provisions are in place to protect the
privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.18

An IRB may waive the requirement to obtain informed consent or
approve an alteration of the consent form for some minimal risk research.
The IRB may also waive the requirement for signed consent in certain
circumstances.19
Anonymized Data
As noted above, the Common Rule considers use of “private identifiable information” to be human subjects research. Data are considered
personally identifiable if the identity of the subject is or may be readily
ascertained by the investigator or associated with the information accessed
by the researcher.20 However, the Common Rule exempts from its requirements research that involves:
17 See 45 C.F.R. § 46.103 (2005).
18 See 45 C.F.R. § 46.111 (2005). There are additional factors if the study includes subjects

who are likely to be vulnerable to coercion or undue influence.

BOX 3-4
Institutional Review Boards
According to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Institutional
Review Board (IRB) guidebook, “the IRB is an administrative body established to
protect the rights and welfare of human research subjects recruited to participate
in research activities conducted under the auspices of the institution with which
it is affiliated. The IRB has the authority to approve, require modifications in, or
disapprove all research activities that fall within its jurisdiction as specified by both
the federal regulations and local institutional policy.”
Therefore, IRBs have enormous responsibility in determining whether health
research projects are planned and orchestrated in a way that minimizes or eliminates the potential risk to human research participants, including direct physical
harms as well as nonphysical harms such as breach of privacy.
An IRB must be made up of at least five members with varying backgrounds
who are sufficiently qualified through experience and expertise, and the diversity
of the members must be sufficient to analyze the proposed research project. The
IRB cannot consist entirely of members from one profession. At least one member
must be unaffiliated with the institution conducting the research, and must not be
part of the immediate family of someone affiliated with the institution. Members
cannot have conflicts of interest with regard to the proposed research project.
Also, there must be one member whose primary concerns are scientific, and one
member whose primary concerns are nonscientific on each IRB.

Otherwise identifiable data may be deidentified or “anonymized” for
purposes of the Common Rule if it is coded and certain other conditions
are met (HHS, 2004). Under Guidance issued by the Office for Human
Research Protection, information is “coded” if identifying information
(such as name or Social Security number) that would enable the investigator to readily ascertain the identity of the individual to whom the private

symbol, or combination thereof (the code), and a key to decipher the code

exists, enabling linkage of the identifying information to the private information or specimen.
Research involving only coded private information or specimens is not
considered to involve human subjects under the Common Rule if the follow­
ing conditions are met:
•
•

The private information or specimens were not collected specifically for the currently proposed research project through an interaction or intervention with living individuals; and
The investigator(s) cannot readily ascertain the identify of the
individual(s) to whom the coded private information or specimens
pertain because, for example:
— The key to decipher the code is destroyed before the research
begins;
— The investigators and the holder of the key enter into an agreement prohibiting the release of the key to the investigators
under any circumstances, until the individuals are deceased;
— IRB-approved written policies and operating procedures for
a repository or data management center prohibit the release
of the key to investigators under any circumstances, until the
individuals are deceased; or
— Other legal requirements prohibit the release of the key to the
investigators, until the individuals are deceased.

Under this standard, when a researcher accesses or receives data that
have been coded and does not have access to the identifying key, the
research is not considered human subjects research and is not subject to
the Common Rule’s requirements of informed consent or IRB review and
approval of protocol.
Enforcement of the Common Rule
The Common Rule requirements for informed consent do not preempt
any applicable federal, state, or local laws that require additional information to be disclosed to a subject in order for informed consent to be legally
effective.22
Federal funding can be suspended or withdrawn from an institution
when it is found to be in material violation of the Common Rule.23 There
is no authority to impose penalties directly on individual researchers for
violations. Neither does the Common Rule expressly provide a research

participant with a private right of action. It should be noted, however,
that recent cases indicate that courts may be willing to hold an institution liable under common law negligence theories where the approved
informed consent form is determined to be less than adequate (Shaul et
al., 2005).24
FDA Protection of Human Research Subjects
Some health research is also subject to FDA regulations. The FDA
is charged by statute with ensuring the protection of the rights, safety,
and welfare of human subjects who participate in clinical investigations25
involving articles subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act26
(the Act), as well as clinical investigations that support applications for
research or marketing permits for products regulated by the FDA, including
drugs, medical devices, and biological products for human use (Box 3-5).
In January 1981, the FDA adopted regulations governing informed
consent of human subjects27 and regulations establishing standards for the
composition, operation, and responsibilities of IRBs that review clinical
investigations involving human subjects.28 At the same time, HHS adopted
the Common Rule regulations on the protection of human research subjects.29 The FDA’s regulations were harmonized with the Common Rule
in 1991 to the extent permitted by statute. Key differences between FDA
and HHS regulations include that the FDA does not allow for waiver or
alteration of informed consent and requires that subjects be informed that
the FDA may inspect their medical records. In addition, studies of efficacy
based solely on medical records research are not permitted to support registration. Remaining differences in the rules are due to differences in the
statutory scope or requirements (Lee, 2000).
Distinguishing Health Research from Practice
The Common Rule and Privacy Rule make a somewhat artificial distinction between health research and some closely related health care practices,
such as public health practice, quality improvement activities, program

FDA Protection of Human Subjects Regulations
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Protection of Human Subjects Regulations aim to protect the rights of human subjects enrolled in research involving products that the FDA regulates (i.e., drugs, medical devices, biologicals,
foods, and cosmetics). For example, the regulations set out a number of steps
researchers must go through before conducting drug research on human subjects.
Researchers must submit a brief statement to the FDA promising that they will
uphold ethical research standards, and identifying the Institutional Review Board
(IRB) that will review the study prior to its start date. Sponsors of the study are
required to submit to the FDA the results of any chemical and animal studies
conducted on the new drug, provide the proposed study procedures for using
human subjects, and ensure that the researchers’ designated IRB will review the
proposed study. The FDA will then review this information to ensure that there
are no unacceptable risks to human subjects, that the project is ethically sound,
and that the research is likely to achieve the study’s objectives. The regulations
give the FDA the right to request modifications to the proposed study, or the right
to reject the proposal as presenting an unacceptable risk to human subjects.
Additionally, the FDA Protection of Human Subjects Regulations allow the FDA
to conduct onsite inspections of IRBs to determine whether they are adhering to
the requirements of the regulation. This portion of the regulation provides the FDA
with the ability to examine IRB minutes, IRB written operating procedures, and
other documents that substantiate the IRB’s review of the research project. The
FDA can also ensure that the IRB reviewing the study meets the membership
requirements stipulated in the regulations, and that the consent forms contain all
the required elements and are signed by all the subjects.

30 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines program evaluation as the “sys-

tematic investigation of the merit, worth, or significance of organized public health action,”
noting that such evaluations are “systematic ways to improve and account for public health
actions by involving procedures that are useful, feasible, ethical, and accurate.” They can be
based on goals, processes, outcomes, or value (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/

evaluation of the medical necessity, appropriateness, and efficiency of the use of health care

challenge for IRBs, Privacy Boards,32 investigators, and health care practitioners because neither the regulations nor their interpretations by HHS
provide clear guidance on how to distinguish research from activities that
use similar techniques to analyze health information (IOM, 2000a).
It is important for IRBs and Privacy Boards to correctly distinguish
among activities that are or are not subject to the various provisions of the
Privacy Rule and the Common Rule. Only research requires formal IRB or
Privacy Board review and informed consent.33 Inappropriate classification
of an activity as research can make it difficult or impossible for important
health care activities, such as public health practice and quality improvement, to be undertaken. On the other hand, failure to correctly identify an
activity as research could potentially allow improper disclosure of personally identifiable health information without sufficient oversight.
Thus, standard criteria are urgently needed for IRBs and Privacy Boards
to use when making distinctions between health research and related activities, and the committee recommends that HHS consult with relevant stakeholders to develop such standard criteria. HHS is aware of this need, and
created a working document titled “What Is Research?” However, the
work on this project apparently has been delayed for unknown reasons
(NCURA, 2007).34 As described below, a number of other models have
already been proposed to help determine whether activities should be classified as research in the fields of public health and quality improvement,
and these could be instructive for developing HHS guidance. Any criteria
adopted by HHS should be regularly evaluated to ensure that they are helpful and producing the desired outcomes.
The following sections describe some ongoing efforts to develop such
criteria in the fields of public health and quality improvement. The intent
of the committee is not to endorse these particular models, but rather
to illustrate the challenges associated with making these distinctions and
establishing standard criteria.
Public Health Practice Versus Public Health Research
The Belmont Report defined health practice as “interventions designed
solely to enhance the well-being of the person, patient or client, and which
have reasonable expectation of success” (CDC, 1999). To apply this definition to “public” health practice, the targeted beneficiary of the intervention
must be expanded to include benefit to the community, rather than just a
particular person. Neither the Common Rule nor the Privacy Rule provides

a specific definition for public health research; rather public health research
is included in the general definition of research. However, the Privacy Rule
regulates public health practice differently from public health research (see
Chapter 4).
An early model for distinguishing public health research from public
health practice focused on the intent for which the activity was designed,
noting that the intent of public health research is to “contribute to or generate generalizable knowledge,” while the intent of public health practice is to
“conduct programs to prevent disease and injury and improve the health of
communities” (Snider and Stroup, 1997). The Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention developed a similar method with an expanded assessment
of intent. For example, the model posits that in public health research, the
intended benefits of the project extend beyond the study participants, and
the data collected exceed the requirements for the care of the study participants. But for public health practice, the intended benefits of the project are
primarily for the participants in the activity, or for the participants’ community, and the only data collected are those needed to assess or improve a
public health program or service, or the health of the participants and their
community. The model also assumes that public health practice is based
on well-established medical interventions and is nonexperimental (CDC,
1999). However, these models both have been criticized as too subjective
and too dependent on the opinion of the person conducting the activity
(Gostin, 2008; Hodge, 2005).
A new, more comprehensive model incorporating much of the previous
two was recently proposed as a more objective checklist to be used by IRBs,
Privacy Boards, and interested parties (Hodge, 2005; Hodge and Gostin,
2004). The foundations for this model are specific definitions of public
health research: “the collection and analysis of identifiable health data by
a public health authority for the purpose of generating knowledge that will
benefit those beyond the participating community who bear the risks of
participation,” and public health practice: “the collection and analysis of
identifiable health data by a public health authority for the purpose of protecting the health of a particular community, where the benefits and risks
are primarily designed to accrue to the participating community.”
The model is based on two primary assumptions. First, the actor performing the activity in question is a governmental public health official,
agent, agency, or entity at the federal, tribal, state, or local level. Second,
the activity in question involves the acquisition, use, or disclosure of personally identifiable health data. The model is then divided into two stages.
Stage 1 is applied to all activities, and can be used to distinguish practice
from research in the easiest cases. Stage 2 is only applied to those cases
that are hard to distinguish, and where Stage 1 failed to lead to a definitive
IRB/Privacy Board decision (Box 3-6).

HEALTH RESEARCH

BOX 3-6
A Model for Distinguishing Public
Health Practice from Research
Stage 1
Public health practice:
•
•
•

•
•

“Involves specific legal authorization for conducting the activity as public health
practice at the federal, state, or local levels;
Includes a corresponding governmental duty to perform the activity to protect
the public’s health;
Involves direct performance or oversight by a governmental public health
authority (or its authorized partner) and accountability to the public for its
performance;
May legitimately involve persons who did not specifically volunteer to participate (i.e., they did not provide informed consent);
Supported by principles of public health ethics that focus on populations while
respecting the dignity and rights of individuals.”

Public health research:
•
•
•
•

“Involves living individuals;
Involves, in part, identifiable private health information;
Involves research subjects who voluntarily participate (or participate with the
consent of their guardian) absent a waiver of informed consent;
Supported by principles of research ethics that focus on the interests of individuals while balancing the communal value of research.”
Stage 2

Legal authority: If authorized by a specific legal authority, the activity is health
care practice. If authorized by general legal authority, analysis depends on whether
the scope and limits of the authorization include research.
Specific intent: The intent of research is to “test a hypothesis and seek to generalize the findings or acquired knowledge beyond the activity’s participants.” The
intent of public health practice is “to assure the conditions in which people can
be healthy through public health efforts that are primarily aimed at prevention of
known or suspected injuries, diseases, or other conditions, or promoting the health
of a particular community.” If the intent of an activity meets both definitions, the
activity should follow research provisions.
Responsibility: In research, the principal investigator is responsible for the
“health, safety, and well-being” of the research participants. In public health practice, a government entity often takes that responsibility.

BOX 3-6 Continued
Participant benefits: In research, participants usually do not receive or expect
any direct benefit from the activity. Public health practice is premised on providing
some benefit to the participants or the population involved in the activity.
Experimentation: Research is experimental, and usually involves a non­standard
intervention or data analysis. Public health practice uses “standard, accepted, and
proven interventions to address known or suspected public health problems.”
Subject selection: In research, subjects are often selected randomly to ensure
the generalizability of the results and reduce the potential for selection bias. Participants are selected for public health practice because they have or are at risk of
having a particular disease or condition, and can likely benefit from the activity.
SOURCES: Hodge (2005); Hodge and Gostin (2004).

Quality Improvement Versus Health Research
Quality improvement has been defined as “systematic, data-guided
activities designed to bring about immediate, positive change in the delivery
of health care in a particular setting” (Baily, 2008). Quality improvement
activities do not require IRB or Privacy Board approval under the ­Common
Rule or the Privacy Rule, which classify quality improvement as a component of health care operations.35
However, in many cases, it is difficult for health care providers, IRBs,
and Privacy Boards to determine whether a particular activity is purely
for quality improvement, or whether it also entails research. One survey36
exploring opinions in the health care community about the need for IRBs
to review various quality-related activities found that physicians conducting
quality improvement were less likely than IRB chairs to believe that IRB
35 The Privacy Rule defines the term “health care operations” by listing a number of specific

activities that qualify as health care operations. These include “conducting quality assessment
and improvement activities, population-based activities relating to improving or reducing
health care costs, and case management and care coordination.” See 45 C.F.R. § 164.501
(2006).
36 A total of 444 surveys were mailed to the medical directors of quality improvement and
IRB chairs at hospitals with 400 or more beds that belong to the Council of Teaching Hospitals of the Association of American Medical Colleges, and to the editors of all U.S.-based
medical journals that publish original research and appear in the Abridged Index Medicus.
236 surveys were returned, for a 53 percent response rate. The survey consisted of six brief
scenarios that asked respondents to determine whether the described project needed IRB
review and informed consent.

review was required for a given hypothetical activity, or that informed consent was necessary (Lindenauer et al., 2002). Recently, a highly publicized
case has again brought the issue to the forefront for all the stakeholders
(Box 3-7).
Some members of the health care community have proposed requiring that all prospective quality improvement activities go through external
review (Bellin and Dubler, 2001), while others have outlined specific criteria
to differentiate quality improvement activities from research.
For example, Casarett and colleagues developed a two-part test to identify quality improvement activities. The first test is whether the majority of

BOX 3-7
A Case Study of Quality Improvement and Research
Peter Pronovost of Johns Hopkins University (JHU) led a quality improvement effort at 103 intensive care units (ICUs) in Michigan hospitals to reduce the
number of catheter-related bloodstream infections. This effort relied on promoting
five medical procedures recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) to reduce infection. The investigators recorded the number of
infections that occurred at the ICU level; no data were recorded at the individual
level.
Prior to starting the quality improvement effort, the investigators submitted
an application to the Johns Hopkins Institutional Review Board (IRB), and classified the project as exempt from the requirements of the Common Rule. The
IRB approved the project as exempt, and did not review the proposal further.
After a description of the quality improvement effort was published in the New
England Journal of Medicine, the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP)
received a letter of complaint that this was research without IRB approval and
without informed consent. OHRP opened a compliance oversight evaluation, and
initially determined that the project was research and needed to go through the
IRB review process. OHRP stated that “quality improvement activities can also be
research activities” and that “JHU failed to ensure the requirements for obtaining
and documenting the legally effective informed consent of the subjects.”
On February 15, 2008, OHRP reversed its initial decision, and concluded that
this activity was a quality improvement effort and was not required to comply
with the regulations governing human subjects research. The Michigan hospitals
have been allowed to continue implementing and studying the effectiveness of
the CDC-recommended procedures in ICUs, and have not been required to get
IRB approval or informed consent. Also at this time, OHRP announced that it was
going to review its policies on quality improvement.

patients are expected to benefit directly from “the knowledge to be gained”
from the initiative. This means that the patients must actually benefit from
the knowledge learned during the evaluation, not just from being a recipient of the protocol itself. If the patients are generally expected to directly
benefit from the knowledge gained during the activity, then the activity
is quality improvement. If not, the activity is research. The second test is
whether the participants would be subjected to additional risks or burdens,
including the risk of privacy breach, beyond the usual clinical practice in
order to make the results of the initiative generalizable. If yes, then the
initiative should be reviewed as research (Casarett et al., 2000).
More recently, the Hastings Center published a report exploring the
similarities and differences between research and quality improvement. The
report emphasized three fundamental characteristics of quality improvement and three fundamental characteristics of research. The authors argue
that individuals have a responsibility to participate in the quality improvement activities because all patients have an interest in receiving highquality medical care, and the success of a quality improvement activity
depends on the cooperation of all patients. In addition, the report notes
that quality improvement activities are a low risk to the patient, so there
is little justification for not participating. The report also assumes that
­quality improvement activities are based on existing knowledge about
human health and should lead to immediate local improvements in the
provision of medical care.
In contrast, the report notes that participation in research should be
voluntary, and decisions to participate should be based on researchers’ full
disclosure of all the potential risks and benefits. In addition, the authors
assert that research is designed to create new knowledge about human
health, rather than relying solely on existing knowledge, and that most
research does not result in any direct benefit to the institution where the
research is being conducted.
The authors concluded that IRBs are not the appropriate body for the
ethical oversight of quality improvement activities. They argue that IRBs
unnecessarily impose high transaction costs on these activities because
of the difference in the way they are conducted compared to research.
For example, in research, any changes in methodology require further
IRB approval. In contrast, quality improvement activities involve frequent
adjustments in the intervention, measurement, and goals of the activity
based on the experience of the investigators. Requiring the investigator to
revisit an IRB every time a small adjustment is needed in such an activity
significantly increases the amount of time and effort required to conduct the
initiative and to produce meaningful data. Also, the investigators involved
in quality improvement activities ordinarily are already involved in the
clinical care of participants and bear responsibility for the quality and

safety of an intervention. Thus, the authors argue that there is no need for
the additional oversight by an IRB to protect participant safety.
Rather, the report recommended integrating the ethical oversight of
quality improvement activities into the ongoing management of an institution’s health care delivery system, suggesting that oversight of quality
improvement could be left with the managers of clinical care organizations,
and that consent to receive treatment should include consent to participate
in any quality improvement project that is minimal risk. However, the
report stated that if a project has the characteristics of both quality improvement and research, the project should be reviewed as both human subjects
research and quality improvement (Baily et al., 2006; Lynn et al., 2007).
In response to the ongoing confusion over when quality improvement
rises to the level of research and requires IRB review, the IOM jointly
hosted a meeting with the American Board of Internal Medicine in May
2008 to discuss this issue. Key members of the quality improvement community attended, and short- and long-term solutions to this problem were
proposed. However, no written report from this meeting was produced and
no general consensus was reached.
The Importance of Effective
Communication with the Public
As noted previously in this chapter, surveys indicate that the vast majority of Americans believe that health research is important and are interested
in the findings of research studies. The majority of patients also appear to
be willing to participate in health research, either by volunteering for a
study to test a medical intervention or by allowing access to their medical
records or stored biospecimens, under certain conditions. Their willingness
to participate depends on trust in researchers to safeguard the rights and
well-being of patients, including assurance of privacy and confidentiality,
and the belief that it is a worthwhile endeavor that warrants their involvement. Yet patients often lack information about how research is conducted,
and are rarely informed about research results that may have a direct
impact on their health. The committee’s recommendations in this section
are intended to address both the public’s desire for more information about
health research and to help fulfill two of the committees overarching goals
of the report: (1) improving the privacy and security of health information,
and (2) improving the effectiveness of health research.
Disseminating Health Research Results
Ethicists have long suggested greater community involvement in health
research studies, including more communication about research results

(reviewed by Shalowitz and Miller, 2008a,b). In addition, the IOM committee identified transparency—the responsibility to disclose clearly how and
why personally identifiable information is being collected—as an important
component of comprehensive privacy protections. A previous IOM report
also recommended improved communication with the public and research
participants to ensure that the protection process is open and accessible to
all interested parties (IOM, 2002). Effective communication would build
the public’s trust of the research community and is consistent with the
principles of fair information practices.
When patients consent to the use of their medical records in a particular study, health researchers should make greater efforts at the conclusion of
the study to inform study participants about the results, and the relevance
and importance of those results. Learning about clinically relevant findings
from a study in which a patient has participated could make patients feel
more integrated into the process and could encourage more to participate
in future studies. A recent United Kingdom report on the use of personal
data in health research concluded that public involvement in research is
necessary for the success of information-based research, and that a public
informed about the value of research is likely to have greater enthusiasm
and confidence in research and the research community (AMS, 2006).
Moreover, direct feedback with study participants could lead to improved
health care for the individuals if the results indicate that an altered course
of care is warranted.
Nonetheless, there are multiple impediments, beyond cost, to providing
meaningful feedback to participants. A summary of the results alone, while
necessary and reasonable, can be seen as a token, and also raises questions
about issues such as how best to write summaries, the stage at which results
should be disseminated, and how to present research with uninformative
outcomes. For example, one recent study found that sharing results directly
with study participants was met with overwhelmingly favorable reactions
from patients, but the study also revealed some obstacles (Partridge et al.,
2008). In a survey of women who had participated in a randomized trial
of breast cancer therapy and had received a summary of the study results
by mail, 95 percent reported that they were glad they received the results.
Most respondents interpreted the results correctly, although incorrect interpretation of the results was associated with increased anxiety, as was dissatisfaction with treatment.
Although some guidelines for providing and explaining study results
to research participants have been proposed, they differ in details because
limited data are available on this subject, and thus standards are lacking
(Partridge and Winer, 2002; Partridge et al., 2008; Shalowitz and Miller,
2008b; Zarin and Tse, 2008). Because transparency is best achieved by
providing graded levels of information and guidance to interested parties

HEALTH RESEARCH

(IOM, 2002), it will be important to develop effective and efficient ways
to communicate with various sectors of the population. A commitment to
the principles of “plain language”37 will be important. Broader adoption of
electronic medical records may also be helpful in accomplishing this goal.
Research Registries
One way to make information about research studies more broadly
available to the public is through registration of trials and other studies
in public databases. HHS should encourage such registration of trials and
other studies, particularly when research is conducted with an IRB/Privacy
Board approved waiver of consent or authorization (see Chapter 4). Numerous clinical trial registries already exist, and registration has increased in
recent years (reviewed by Zarin and Tse, 2008). In 2000, the National
Library of Medicine established a clinical trials registry (ClinicalTrials.gov),
which has expanded to include information from several other trial registries and to serve as the FDA-required site for submissions about clinical
trials subject to the FDA databank requirement. The FDA Amendments Act
of 200738 expanded the scope of required registrations at ClinicalTrials.gov
and provided the first federally funded trials results database. It mandates
registrations of controlled clinical investigations, except for Phase I trials,
of drugs, biologics, and devices subject to FDA regulation.
A policy of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors
(ICMJE), adopted in fall 2005, also requires prospective trial registration
as a precondition for publication (DeAngelis et al., 2004). This policy led
to a 73 percent increase in trial registrations of all intervention types from
around the world (Zarin et al., 2005). Nearly 45,000 trials had been registered by fall 2007.
However, although the development of such registries is an important
first step toward providing high-quality clinical trial information to the
public, no centralized system currently exists to disseminate information
about clinical trials of drugs or other interventions, making it difficult
for consumers and their health care providers to identify ongoing studies.
The current statutory requirements for registration and data reporting
in the United States are not as broad as the transnational policies of the
ICMJE or the World Health Organization, which call for the registration
of all interventional studies in human beings regardless of intervention type
(Laine et al., 2007; Sim et al., 2006). Moreover, noninterventional studies, such as observational studies that play an increasingly critical role in
biomedical research, are not generally included in these databases. Because

142

BEYOND THE HIPAA PRIVACY RULE

many noninterventional studies are conducted with an IRB/Privacy Board
approved waiver of consent or authorization, including those studies in a
registry could be an important method for increasing public knowledge of
such studies.
Informing the Public About the Methods and Value of Research
As noted previously, clinical trials are the most visible of the various
types of health research, but a great deal of information-based health
research entails analysis of thousands of patient records to better understand human diseases, to determine treatment effectiveness, and to identify
adverse side effects of therapies. This form of research is likely to increase in
frequency as the availability of electronic records continues to expand. As
we move toward the goal of personalized medicine, research results will be
even more likely to be directly relevant to patients, but more study subjects
will be necessary to derive meaningful results.
However, many patients probably are not aware that their medical
records are being used in information-based research. For example, the
recent study that used focus groups to examine the views of veterans
toward the use of medical records in research found that the majority of
participants (75 percent) were not aware that “under some circumstances,
[their] medical records could be used in some research studies without
[their] permission,” despite the fact that a notice of privacy practices, which
included a statement that such research could occur, had been mailed to
all participants less than a year prior to the study (Damschroder et al.,
2007).
Moreover, surveys show that many patients desire not only notice, but
also the opportunity to decide whether to consent to such research with
medical records. Those surveys further indicate that patients who wish to be
asked for consent for each study are most concerned about the potentially
detrimental affects of inappropriate disclosure of their personally identifiable health information, including discrimination in obtaining health or life
insurance or employment.
As noted in Chapter 2, strengthening security protections of health data
should reduce the risk of security breaches and their potential negative consequences, and thus should help to alleviate patient concerns in this regard.
But educating patients about how health research is conducted, monitored,
and reported on could also help to ease patient concerns about privacy and
increase patients’ trust in the research community, which as noted above is
important for the public’s continued participation in health research. For
example, datasets are most often provided to researchers without direct
identifiers such as name and Social Security number. Furthermore, identifiers are not included in publications about research results. Also, under

HEALTH RESEARCH

both the Privacy Rule and the Common Rule, a waiver of consent and
authorization is possible only under the supervision of an IRB or Privacy
Board, and a waiver is granted only when the research entails minimal risk
and when obtaining individual consent and authorization is impracticable
(see the previous section and also Chapter 4). Finally, professional ethics
dictate that researchers safeguard data and respect privacy.
Conveying the value of medical records research to patients will be
important. Surveys show that people are more supportive of research that
is relevant to them and their loved ones. At the same time, educational
efforts should stress the negative impact of incomplete datasets on research
findings. Representative samples are essential to ensure the validity and
generalizability of health research (Box 3-8), but datasets will not represent the entire population if some people withhold access to their health
information.
In addition, an educated public could also decrease the potential for
biased research samples. A universal requirement for consent or authorization in medical records research leads to incomplete datasets, and thus to
biased results and inaccurate conclusions. Some large medical institutions
with a strong research history and reputation (e.g., Mayo Clinic) can obtain
authorization and consent rates as high as 80 percent, but the 20 percent

BOX 3-8
Selection Bias in Health Research
When researchers are required to obtain consent or authorization to access
each individual’s medical record for a research study, it is likely that individuals’
willingness to grant access will not be random, and will vary in a way that may
bias the study results—a phenomenon known as selection bias. A study sample
is biased if certain members are underrepresented or overrepresented relative to
others in the population. A biased sample causes problems because any statistic
computed from that sample has the potential to be consistently erroneous. The
bias can lead to an over- or underrepresentation of the corresponding parameter
being studied in the population. Typically this causes measures of statistical significance to appear much stronger than they are, but it is also possible to cause
completely illusory artifacts. In either case, conclusions drawn from a biased
sample are likely to be invalid. The requirement to obtain consent or authorization may lead to a biased study sample because those who decline to participate
may be more or less likely than average to have a particular health problem. This
may be especially problematic if the research topic entails sensitive or potentially
embarrassing information, such as HIV infection.

who refuse have distinct demographic and health characteristics. In fact,
even a refusal rate of less than 5 percent can create selection bias in the data
(Jacobsen et al., 1999; see Chapter 5 for more detail). Conveying to the
public the importance of health care improvements derived from medical
records research and stressing the negative impact of incomplete datasets
on research findings may increase the public’s participation in research and
their willingness to support information-based research that is conducted
with IRB or Privacy Board oversight, under a waiver of patient consent or
authorization.
Numerous examples of important research findings from medical
records research would not have been possible if direct patient consent and
authorization were always required (Box 3-1). For example, analysis of
medical records showed that infants exposed to diethylstilbesterol (DES)
during the first trimester of pregnancy had an increased risk of breast,
vaginal, and cervical cancer as well as reproductive anomalies as adults.
Similarly, studies of medical records led to the discovery that folic acid
supplementation during pregnancy can prevent neural tube defects.
Thus, HHS and the health research community should work to educate the public about how research is done and the value it provides. All
stakeholders, including professional organizations, nonprofit funders, and
patient organizations, have different interests and responsibilities to make
sure that their constituencies are well informed. For example, the American
Society of Clinical Oncology and the American Heart Association already
have some online resources to help patients gather information about
research that may be relevant to their conditions. But coordination and
identification of best practices by HHS would be helpful, and research is
needed to identify which segments of the population would be receptive to
and benefit from various types of information about how research is done
and its value in order to create and implement an effective plan.
Greater use of community-based participatory research, in which
­community-based organizations or groups bring community members into
the research process as partners to help design studies and disseminate
the knowledge gained,39 could help achieve this goal. These groups help
researchers to recruit research participants by using the knowledge of the
community to understand health problems and to design activities that
the community is likely to value. They also inform community members
about how the research is done and what comes out of it, with the goal of
providing immediate community benefits from the results when possible.

Conclusions AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on its review of the information described in this chapter, the
committee agreed on a second overarching principle to guide the formation
of recommendations. The committee affirms the importance of maintaining
and improving health research effectiveness. Research discoveries are central
to achieving the goal of extending the quality of healthy lives. Research into
causes of disease, methods for prevention, techniques for diagnosis, and
new approaches to treatment has increased life expectancy, reduced infant
mortality, limited the toll of infectious diseases, and improved outcomes
for patients with heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and other chronic diseases.
Patient-oriented clinical research that tests new ideas makes rapid medical
progress possible. Today, the rate of discovery is accelerating, and we are at
the precipice of a remarkable period of investigative promise made possible
by new knowledge about the genetic underpinnings of disease. Genomic
research is opening new possibilities for preventing illness and for developing safer, more effective medical care that may eventually be tailored for
specific individuals. Further advances in relating genetic information to
predispositions to disease and responses to treatments will require the use
of large amounts of existing health-related information and stored tissue
specimens. The increasing use of electronic medical records will further
facilitate the generation of new knowledge through research and accelerate the pace of discovery. These efforts will require broad participation of
patients in research and broad data sharing to ensure that the results are
valid and applicable to different segments of the population. Collaborative
partnerships among communities of patients, their physicians, and teams
of researchers to gain new scientific knowledge will bring tangible benefits
for people in this country and around the world.
Surveys indicate that the majority of Americans believe that health
research is important, are interested in the findings of research studies, and
are willing to participate in health research. But patients often lack information about how research is conducted and are rarely informed about
research results that may have a direct impact on their health. Effective
communication could build the public’s trust of the research community,
which is important because trust is necessary for the public’s continued
participation in research. Moreover, direct feedback could lead to improved
health care for study participants if the results indicate that an altered
course of care is warranted.
Thus, the committee recommends that when patients consent to the
use of their medical records in a particular study, health researchers should
make greater efforts when the study ends to inform study participants about
the results, and the relevance and importance of those results. Broader adoption of electronic health records may be helpful in accomplishing this goal,

but standards and guidelines for providing and explaining study results to
research participants or various sectors of the public are needed.
HHS should also encourage registration of trials and other studies in
public databases, particularly when research is conducted with an IRB/
Privacy Board approved waiver of consent or authorization, as a way to
make information about research studies more broadly available to the
public. Numerous clinical trial registries already exist, and registration has
increased in recent years, but no centralized system currently exists for disseminating information about clinical trials of drugs or other interventions,
making it difficult for consumers and their health care providers to identify
ongoing studies. Moreover, noninterventional studies, such as observational
studies that play an increasingly critical role in biomedical research, are not
generally included in these databases. Because many noninterventional studies are conducted with an IRB/Privacy Board approved waiver of consent
or authorization, including such studies in a registry could be an important
method for increasing public knowledge of those studies.
Interventional clinical trials are the most visible of the various types
of health research, but a great deal of information-based health research
entails ­analysis of thousands of patient records to better understand human
diseases, to determine treatment effectiveness, and to identify adverse side
effects of therapies. This form of research is likely to increase in frequency
as the availability of electronic health records continues to expand. As we
move toward the goal of personalized medicine, research results will be
even more likely to be directly relevant to patients, but more study participants will be necessary to derive meaningful results.
However, many patients are likely not aware that their medical records
are being used in information-based research, and surveys show that many
patients desire not only notice, but also the opportunity to decide about
whether to consent to such research with medical records. As noted in
Chapter 2, strengthening security protections of health data should reduce
the risk of security breaches and their potential negative consequences, and
thus should help to alleviate patient concerns in this regard. But educating
patients about how health research is conducted, monitored, and reported
could also increase patients’ trust in the research community. Thus, HHS
and the health research community should work to educate the public
about how research is done.
It will also be important for HHS and researchers to convey the value
of health care improvements derived from medical records research, and
to stress the negative impact of incomplete datasets on research findings.
Representative samples are essential to ensure the validity and generalizability of health research, but datasets will not be representative of the entire
population if some people withhold access to their health information. A
universal requirement for consent or authorization in information-based

research may lead to incomplete datasets, and thus to biased results and
inaccurate conclusions. Numerous examples of important research findings
from medical records research would not have been possible if direct patient
consent and authorization were always required.
To ensure that beneficial health research and related activities continue
to be undertaken with appropriate oversight under federal regulations, it
will be important for HHS to also provide more guidance on how to distinguish the various activities. The Privacy Rule makes a distinction between
health research and some closely related endeavors, such as public health
and quality improvement activities, which also may involve collection and
analysis of personally identifiable health information. Under the Privacy
Rule (as well as the Common Rule), these activities, which aim to ��������
protect
the public’s health���������������������������������������������������������
and improve the quality of patient care, are considered
health care “practice” rather than health research. Therefore, they can be
undertaken without consent or authorization, or an IRB/Privacy Board
waiver of consent or authorization. However, it can be a challenge for IRBs
and Privacy Boards to distinguish among activities that are or are not subject to the various provisions of the Privacy Rule and the Common Rule,
and inappropriate decisions may prevent important activities from being
undertaken or could potentially allow improper disclosure of personally
identifiable health information.
To address these difficulties, a number of models have been proposed
that outline the criteria IRBs and Privacy Boards should use to distinguish
practice and research. For example, one recent model provides a detailed
checklist for IRBs and Privacy Boards to use in determining whether an
activity is public health research and required to comply with the research
provisions of the Privacy Rule, or public health practice that does not need
IRB/Privacy Board review. The committee believes that standardizing the
criteria is essential to support the conduct of these important health care
activities.
Thus, HHS should convene the relevant stakeholders to develop
standard criteria for IRBs and Privacy Boards to use when making decisions about whether protocols entail research or practice. There should
be flexibility in the regulation to allow important activities to go forward
with appropriate levels of oversight. Also, it will be important to evaluate
whether these criteria are effective in aiding IRB/Privacy Board reviews
of proposed protocols, and whether they lead to appropriate IRB/Privacy
Board decisions.
These changes suggested above could be accomplished without any
changes to HIPAA by making them a condition of funding from HHS and
other research sponsors and by providing some additional funds to cover
the cost.

HIPAA, the Privacy Rule, and
Its Application to Health Research

This chapter provides an overview of the development of the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule and
describes how it applies to health research. A section at the end of the
chapter also describes the relationships between HIPAA and other federal
and state laws. Because a great deal of health research in the United States
is also subject to the Common Rule (described in Chapter 3), disparities
between these two federal rules are also noted where relevant throughout
the chapter.
Overview of HIPAA
HIPAA was passed on August 21, 1996. It was intended to make health
care delivery more efficient and to increase the number of Americans with
health insurance coverage. These objectives were pursued through three
main provisions of the Act: (1) the portability provisions, (2) the tax provisions, and (3) the administrative simplification provisions.
Portability and Tax Provisions
The portability provisions of HIPAA aimed to prevent individuals from
losing health care coverage due to a preexisting condition when changing
to a new employer’s health plan. The portability provisions also aimed to
reduce the number of unemployed or self-employed individuals without
health insurance by making it easier for individuals to purchase health
insurance without their employer.

Similarly, the tax provisions of HIPAA were also intended to make
it easier for individuals to maintain health insurance. The tax provisions
pursued this goal by modifying existing tax laws to make health insurance
more affordable. HIPAA does not regulate the price of health insurance,
but rather, it relies on tax breaks and other tax incentives to reduce health
care costs (Chaikind et al., 2005).
Administrative Simplification Provisions
The administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA instructed the
Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to
issue several regulations concerning the electronic transmission of health
information. These provisions were included in the final version of HIPAA
because health plans had requested federal legislation in this area from
Congress. The use of electronic health information was expanding in the
early 1990s, and the health care industry was unable to standardize the
process and use of electronic health information without federal action.
The security standards are one set of regulations mandated by the
administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA. The Act instructed the
Secretary of HHS to develop nationwide security standards and safeguards
for the use of electronic health care information. The resulting HHS regulations spell out specific administrative, technical, and physical security
procedures that healthcare plans, providers and clearinghouses must incorporate into their operations to prevent unauthorized access, use, and disclosure of protected health information (CMS, 2005). HHS published the
final HIPAA Security Rule in the Federal Register on February 20, 2003.
Health plans and providers were required to be in compliance with these
measures by April 2004 (see Box 2-2).
The administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA also directed
the Secretary to develop standards for unique health identifiers for patients,
employers, health plans, and providers. Unique health identifiers are
national numbers that could be used to identify the individual or organization in standard health transactions. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
Services (CMS) has issued standards for the unique health identifiers for
employers and providers, and unique health identifiers for health plans are
under development. However, Congress has prevented CMS from implementing a standard for the unique health identifier for patients by inserting
language into the annual appropriations bill every year since HIPAA was
enacted (Chaikind et al., 2005).
Finally, the administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA mandated the creation of privacy standards for the protection of personally

identifiable medical information. Although privacy protections were not
a primary objective of the Act, Congress recognized that advances in
electronic technology could erode the privacy of health information, and
included the privacy provision in HIPAA (IOM, 2006). In accordance with
the administrative simplification provisions, HHS developed the Privacy
Rule, which constitutes a broad-ranging federal health privacy regulation
(see Table 4-1). Incorporating many of the basic fair information practices,
the Privacy Rule generally restricts the use or disclosure of protected health
information, except as permitted by the individual or as authorized or
required by the Privacy Rule. Its provisions also impose on covered entities
affirmative requirements to safeguard the information in their possession.
The Privacy Rule gives individuals certain rights with respect to their health
information (reviewed by Pritts, 2008).
Development of the Privacy Rule Regulations
Congress did not include detailed privacy requirements in HIPAA. The
terms of HIPAA required the Secretary of HHS to submit detailed recommendations to Congress by August 1997 on ways to protect the privacy of
personally identifiable health information. These recommendations were
to include suggestions on ways to protect individuals’ rights concerning
their personally identifiable health information, procedures for exercising
such rights, and the uses and disclosures of information that should be
authorized or required under HIPAA. If Congress did not enact privacy
legislation within 3 years of the passage of HIPAA, the Act required
the Secretary of HHS to issue privacy regulations for the protection of
personally identifiable health information within 42 months of HIPAA’s
enactment.
In response to this mandate, HHS submitted recommendations for protecting the privacy of personally identifiable health information to Congress
in September 1997. In these recommendations, Secretary Shalala advocated
for the passage of federal privacy legislation, rather than relying on HHS to
pass a set of privacy regulations. Shalala’s report stated, “This report recommends that Congress enact national standards that provide fundamental
privacy rights for patients and define responsibilities for those who service
them” (Shalala, 1997).

2001). First, HHS issued a proposed version of the Privacy Rule for public
comment on November 3, 1999, that drew more than 50,000 comments
(Stevens, 2000). Based on these comments, HHS issued the second version
of the Privacy Rule, titled Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable
Health Information, in December 2000. Before this version of the Privacy
Rule could take effect, the Secretary of HHS was inundated with ­unsolicited
public comments and criticism regarding the Privacy Rule. Health care
insurers and providers were concerned that the Privacy Rule would make
health care industry operations less efficient. They were particularly concerned about the requirement that they obtain authorization prior to making any routine disclosure of personally identifiable health information for
health care operations, treatment, or payment. The comments received also
suggested that this version of the Privacy Rule would prevent pharmacists
from filling prescriptions and searching for potential drug interactions
before patients arrived at pharmacies; interfere with providing emergency
medicine in situations where it would be impossible to obtain patient
authorization before treatment; and delay the scheduling and preparation of
hospital procedures until the doctor could obtain patient authorization.
In March 2002, HHS, under the Bush Administration, published
a proposed modification to the Privacy Rule, which reopened the rulemaking process and created a new period for submitting public comments.
This version of the Privacy Rule drew more than 24,000 comments. Incorporating the suggestions collected through the second notice of proposed
rule-making period, HHS issued the final version of the Privacy Rule in
August 14, 2002. This is the current, effective, and codified version of the
Privacy Rule (45 C.F.R. parts 160 and 164). Most health care providers
and health plans were required to be in compliance with this version of
the Privacy Rule by April 14, 2003. Small health plans were given until
April 14, 2004, to be in compliance.

course of normal health care practices. Covered entities include health care
providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses. Health plans are
entities that provide or pay the cost of medical care, such as private health
insurers or managed care organizations, and governmental payors and
health programs such as Medicaid, Medicare, or Veterans Affairs. Health
care clearinghouses generally refer to billing services, and health care providers include hospitals, doctors, and other health care professionals and
facilities that provide treatment (Table 4-2).
If an entity that meets one of the categories of a covered entity also
performs functions unrelated to health care, it can become a hybrid entity
by designating in writing its “health care components.”10 Only these health
care components are then bound by the Privacy Rule. For example, if a
university includes an academic medical center with a hospital, the entire
university will be classified as a covered entity unless the university elects
to be a hybrid entity by designating only the hospital as the health care
component. By doing this, only the hospital has to comply with the Privacy
Rule. The classification of researchers within a hybrid entity depends on
the nature of the work performed (e.g., whether the researchers are within
the health care component, providing health care, or conducting electronic
transactions) (HHS, 2004c).
Type of Information Protected
The Privacy Rule protects all personally identifiable health information, known as protected health information (PHI), created or received
by a covered entity. Personally identifiable health information is defined
as information, including demographic information, that “relates to past,
present, or future physical or mental health or condition of an individual,
the provision of health care to an individual, or the past, present, or future
payment for the provision of health care for the individual” that either
identifies the individual or with respect to which there is a reasonable basis
to believe the information can be used to identify the individual.”11
The Privacy Rule does not protect personally identifiable health information that is held or maintained by an organization other than a covered
entity (HHS, 2004c). It also does not apply to information that has been
deidentified in accordance with the Privacy Rule12 (see later section on
Deidentified Information).

Restrictions on Use and Disclosure
Covered entities may not use or disclose PHI except as permitted or
required by the Privacy Rule.13 A covered entity may disclose PHI without
the individual’s permission for treatment, payment, and health care operations purposes. For other uses and disclosures, the Privacy Rule generally
requires the individual’s written permission, which is an “authorization”
that must meet specific content requirements. The Privacy Rule then establishes a number of exceptions to this general rule, allowing covered entities
to use and disclose PHI without the individual’s authorization in certain
situations. For example, the Privacy Rule permits the disclosure of PHI
without the individual’s authorization in the following circumstances:
•
•
•

To business associates14
For public health purposes as required by state and federal law15
To public agencies for health oversight activities, such as audits;

13 See 45 C.F.R. § 164.502(a) (2006). A covered entity is required to make a reasonable
effort to use and disclose only the minimum amount of PHI needed for the intended purpose.
See 45 C.F.R. § 164.502(b) (2006).
14 See 45 C.F.R. § 164.506(e) (2006).

inspections; civil, criminal, or administrative proceedings; and other
activities necessary for the oversight of the health care system16
To law enforcement officials17
For judicial and administrative proceedings, if the request for information is made through a court order18
For research19

Most of these permitted uses and disclosures are subject to detailed
conditions. For example, the Privacy Rule allows covered entities to disclose
PHI without individual authorization to its “business associates,” which
are defined as persons or entities that perform, on behalf of the covered
entity, certain functions or services20 that require the use or disclosure of
PHI, provided adequate safeguards are in place.21 As a general rule, these
safeguards take the form of a business associate agreement whereby the
business associate agrees not to use or disclose the PHI it receives except as
permitted by the agreement or by law (Box 4-1).
In the case of public health practice, the Privacy Rule notes that there is a
legitimate need for public health authorities and others working to ensure the
health and safety of the public to have access to PHI. As a result, the Privacy
Rule permits, but does not require,22 covered entities to disclose PHI without
authorization for specified public health purposes (Box 4-2). Disclosures for
research are discussed in detail in subsequent sections of this chapter.
Individual Rights
The Privacy Rule also confers rights on individuals with respect to their
PHI (reviewed by Pritts, 2008). Under the Privacy Rule, individuals have
the right to23:
•

Receive a notice of privacy practices from a health care provider
or a health plan that must, among other things, inform patients of

recruiting subjects, data analysis, processing, or administration; utilization review; quality
assurance; and practice management.

Administration (FDA), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration.”

HIPAA and Research

Although health research was not a focus of HIPAA, Congress recognized the important role that health records play in conducting health
research and wanted to ensure that privacy protections would not impede
researchers’ continued access to such data. This is reflected in two House
Reports on HIPAA with identical language, stating:
“The conferees recognize that certain uses of individually identifiable
information are appropriate, and do not compromise the privacy of an
individual. Examples of such use of information include . . . the transfer
of information from a health plan to an organization for the sole purpose
of conducting health care-related research. As health plans and providers
continue to focus on outcomes research and innovation, it is important
that the exchange and aggregated use of health care data be allowed” (U.S.
Congress, 1996a,b).
In creating the current research provisions of the Privacy Rule, HHS
considered several options. One option considered was exempting PHI used
in research from the regulations, but HHS rejected this option, noting some
reported shortcomings of the protection of the privacy and confidentiality of health information in research (reviewed by Pritts, 2008).28 A U.S.
General Accounting Office report prepared in anticipation of federal health
privacy legislation noted that confidentiality protections were not a major
thrust of the Common Rule, and oversight boards tended to give confidentiality less attention than other research risks because they had the flexibility to decide when it was appropriate to review confidentiality protection
issues (GAO, 1999). The report noted that although “[t]he actual number
of instances in which patient privacy is breached is not fully known . . . in

an NIH [National Institutes of Health] sponsored study, IRB [Institutional
Review Board] chairs reported that complaints about the lack of privacy
and confidentiality were among the most common complaints made by
research subjects.” In addition, the compliance staff of the HHS Office for
Protection from Research Risks (now Office of Human Research Protections) related that they had investigated several allegations involving human
subjects protection violations resulting from a breach of confidentiality over
the past several years and that the complaints related to (1) research subject
to IRB review and (2) research outside federal protection (GAO, 1999).
HHS also considered requiring researchers to obtain individual authorization in all situations where a covered entity might want to disclose
PHI for research. But this option would have made many research projects
nearly impossible to carry out. Instead, HHS created the current system,
which attempted to protect individual privacy while still allowing researchers access to data.
In proposing the Privacy Rule, HHS acknowledged that ideally, it
would have preferred to directly regulate researchers by extending the protections of the Common Rule to nonfederally funded research and imposing
additional criteria for the waiver of authorization in research.29 However,
HHS recognized that it did not have the authority to do so, and therefore,
it attempted to protect the health information released to researchers indirectly (but within the scope of its limited authority) by imposing disclosure
restrictions on covered entities.
The following sections provide a detailed overview of the Privacy Rule
provisions regulating research, along with comparisons to the provisions
of the Common Rule (see Chapter 3 for a general overview of the Common Rule).
Research Uses and Disclosures with Individual Authorization
Individuals may voluntarily authorize the use and disclosure of their
PHI for essentially any reason, including for research purposes. To be
valid under the Privacy Rule, an authorization must be “specific and
­meaningful”30—that is, it must provide a clear description of the information to be used or disclosed. The authorization must also be written
in plain language, and contain core elements (e.g., signature of the individual, description of purpose of requested use or disclosure) and statements addressing the individual’s right to revoke authorization, as well as

29 See Secretary Recommendations (1997) and 64 Fed. Reg. 59918, 59968 (1999).

circumstances under which services or payment may be conditioned on
signing the authorization.31
Authorization under the Privacy Rule differs from informed consent in
research (reviewed by Pritts, 2008). Authorization states how, why, and to
whom the PHI will be used and/or disclosed for research, and seeks permission for that use or disclosure. In contrast, informed consent describes the
potential risks and benefits of research and seeks permission to involve the
subject, although it also provides research participants with a description
of how the confidentiality of the research records will be protected. The
Privacy Rule permits, but does not require, review of authorization forms
by an IRB or a Privacy Board (see Box 4-3). In contrast, under the Common
Rule, IRBs are required to review and approve informed consent documents
for human subjects research. However, if the authorization is combined in
the same document as the informed consent document, then IRB approval
must be sought for the combination (HHS, 2004c).
Authorization of Future Research
Under the Common Rule, it is permissible to obtain patient consent for
future research with biological samples or information stored in databases,
with oversight by an IRB, if such future uses are described in sufficient
detail to allow an informed consent. Historically, IRBs typically have tried
to craft informed consent language on a case-by-case basis to allow for
some measure of consent to future, largely unspecified research uses, but
also to require some level of detail with respect to the categories of types
of uses of the information or specimens, and to emphasize confidentiality
protections for identified data and tissues (Barnes and Heffernan, 2004).
For example, a consent form may specify that the tissue will be kept for
research to learn about, prevent, or treat the type of cancer that affects
the subject.
However, such language is too general to comply with the more stringent HIPAA authorization requirements. Under the Privacy Rule, authorizations for the use or disclosure of PHI must include “[a] description of each
purpose of the requested use or disclosure.”32 In the August 2002 Final
Rule, HHS commented that research-related purposes described in the
authorization must be “study specific” and indicated that authorizations
for “unspecified future research” would be considered overly broad and

31 As a general rule, covered entities may not condition the provision of treatment payment

or eligibility for benefits on the provision of an authorization (with the exception of researchrelated treatment). See 45 C.F.R. § 164.508(b)(4) (2006).

BOX 4-3
IRBs and Privacy Boards
Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) and Privacy Boards have different scopes
of review. The Common Rule requires IRBs to review research projects involving
human subjects for risk of harm to the subjects and to ensure that the appropriate process of informed consent is followed for all research participants. The
Privacy Rule added to IRBs’ jurisdiction by giving them the responsibility of granting ­waivers of authorization. In contrast, Privacy Boards did not exist under the
Common Rule. Privacy Boards were created by the Privacy Rule and only have
authority to review applications for waivers of authorization.
The Privacy Rule did not change the IRB membership requirements from
the Common Rule (see also Box 3-3). Privacy Boards have similar membership
requirements to IRBs, and must be made up of members with varying backgrounds and have appropriate professional competency to review the research
protocol. There must be one member who is not affiliated with any entity conducting or sponsoring the research project and not related to any person who is affiliated with any of these entities. Also, all members with conflicts of interest must
be removed.

invalid.33 In other words, HHS regards all future uses of PHI as inherently
nonspecific, and the Privacy Rule does not permit an individual to grant
authorization to nonspecific research.
For example, the creation and maintenance of a biospecimen bank or
database is considered a specific research activity under the Privacy Rule,
but authorization for any future studies undertaken with the data or materials cannot be sought at the time of collection. However, the process of
recontacting individuals whose biospecimens are stored to obtain consent
for each and every research project for which the samples could be used is
widely viewed as impractical, if not impossible, especially as more and more
samples are collected. This situation can be quite problematic for studies
using stored biological samples (Barnes and Heffernan, 2004; Bledsoe,
2004; Rosati, 2008; Rothstein, 2005).
HHS received comments suggesting that general descriptions of future
research could meet the requirement of “meaningful and specific” authorization, but HHS noted that the Privacy Rule does not require IRB or
Privacy Board review of uses and disclosures made with individual authori33 See 67 Fed. Reg. 53181, 53226 (2002).

zation, and thus covered entities would be left to decide whether or not the
initial authorization was broad enough to cover subsequent research.34 The
HHS response went on to note that authorization for future research would
not be required if a waiver of authorization was granted for a subsequent
study by an IRB or a Privacy Board (see the section regarding Waiver of
Authorization).
However, the committee recommends that this discordance between
the Privacy Rule and the Common Rule be eliminated through guidance
explicitly stating that future research may go forward if the authorization
describes the types or categories of research that may be conducted with
the PHI stored in a biospecimen bank or database, and if an IRB or Privacy
Board determines that the proposed new research is not incompatible with
the initial consent and authorization and poses no greater than minimal risk
to the privacy of individuals (Wendler, 2006). Future consent for research
is ethically valid if appropriate security measures are in place, donors have
the right to withdraw consent, and new studies are reviewed and approved
by an IRB or Privacy Board (Hansson et al., 2006). Furthermore, a prohibition on future consent actually limits individual autonomy. If individuals
desire to authorize the use of their PHI for future research, they should be
able to do so.
Compound Authorization
If a covered entity plans to collect and store PHI in a research repository in conjunction with a clinical trial, HHS has stated that the HIPAA
authorization for storage of the PHI in the repository must be separate from
the HIPAA authorization for disclosure of PHI associated with participation in the clinical trial. HHS came to this conclusion through a complex
series of interpretive steps (reviewed by Rosati, 2008). First, it is generally
not permissible to condition treatment on the provision of an authorization, although the Privacy Rule does permit a covered entity to condition
treatment in a clinical trial on signing an authorization.35 Second, although
the Privacy Rule generally permits researchers to combine an authorization form with any other type of written permission (including another
authorization), the Privacy Rule prohibits combining authorizations where
the covered entity conditions the provision of treatment on signing only
one of the authorizations, but not the other.36 Because HHS has concluded
that collection of PHI for a clinical trial and for a repository are separate
research activities, researchers cannot condition participation in the clini34 Id.

cal trial on signing authorization to include PHI in the repository (HHS,
2004d). Thus, HHS has determined that the two authorizations cannot be
combined in one form unless the form has separate signature lines for each
authorization, and the text clearly delineates the two activities and states
that the participant is not required to sign the portion authorizing the contribution of PHI to the repository.
Ideally, all relevant information pertaining to authorization should be
integrated into one simple document, but there is much confusion about
these complex provisions of the HIPAA Privacy Rule (Rosati, 2008).
Misperceptions about restrictions on individuals’ ability to provide compound authorization for the related activities of clinical trial participation
and biospecimen donation are widespread. Some institutions require two
complete authorization forms with all the attendant language rather than
two signature lines on the same form. The excess paperwork that results is
burdensome for patients, can reduce the informed nature of authorization
by confusing patients, and may reduce patient participation in research.
The committee believes that guidance from HHS to clearly indicate that
a single authorization form with two signature lines is permissible in such
circumstances would reduce variability and increase the informed nature
of authorization.
Research Uses and Disclosures Without Individual Authorization
Documented IRB or Privacy Board Approval of Such Use or Disclosure
In crafting the Privacy Rule, HHS acknowledged that it is not always
possible to obtain authorization for using or disclosing PHI for research,
particularly in fields such as health services research and epidemiological
research, where thousands of records may be involved (Pritts, 2008). It also
recognized the potential for selection bias (see Box 3-8) when authorization
is required. In light of these factors, HHS concluded that there were circumstances under which it is appropriate to disclose PHI for research without
authorization. HHS noted, however, “[T]he privilege of using individually
identifiable health information for research purposes without individual
authorization requires that the information be used and disclosed under
strict conditions that safeguard individuals’ confidentiality.”37
One situation in which the Privacy Rule permits a covered entity to use
and disclose PHI for research purposes without obtaining authorization
from each patient is when an IRB or a Privacy Board (Box 4-3) reviews a

research proposal to use PHI and determines whether to grant a “waiver”
of authorization to the researcher for that particular research protocol.38
The Privacy Rule sets out complex standards for IRBs and Privacy
Boards to apply in deciding whether to grant a waiver of authorization for
a particular research study. The IRBs and Privacy Boards must determine
whether a study meets all of the following criteria39:
(A) The use or disclosure of PHI involves no more than a minimal risk
to the privacy of individuals, based on, at least, the presence of the
following elements:
(1) An adequate plan to protect the identifiers from improper use
and disclosure;
(2) An adequate plan to destroy the identifiers at the earliest opportunity consistent with conduct of the research, unless there is
a health or research justification for retaining the identifiers or
such retention is otherwise required by law; and
(3) Adequate written assurances that the PHI will not be reused
or disclosed to any other person or entity, except as required
by law, for authorized oversight of the research study, or for
other research for which the use or disclosure of PHI would be
permitted by this subpart;
(B) The research could not practicably be conducted without the waiver
or alteration; and
(C) The research could not practicably be conducted without access to
and use of the PHI.
An IRB or a Privacy Board may waive the authorization requirement
in whole or in part. A complete waiver of authorization means that no
authorization is required for the covered entity to use and disclose PHI.
A partial waiver means that the IRB or Privacy Board determined that a
covered entity does not need authorization for the uses and disclosure of the
PHI for one part of a research project, but does need to obtain authorization from patients for another part of the project. For example, an IRB or a
Privacy Board often grants a partial waiver to allow PHI to be disclosed to
researchers to access PHI to identify potential subjects for a study. However,
if only a partial waiver of authorization is granted, the researchers will need
to obtain HIPAA authorization before the PHI for each individual patient is
used for the research project. An IRB or Privacy Board may also approve a
request for an alteration that removes some, but not all, required elements
of an authorization, using the same criteria for a waiver of authorization.

The final and codified provisions above share only some of the language
used in the Common Rule40 to determine whether it is allowable to alter
the elements of informed consent or to waive the requirement of obtaining informed consent. This difference can create a challenge for the IRB
­decision-making process (Rothstein, 2005).
The concept of “practicability” is used in both the Common Rule
and in the HIPAA authorization criteria, but there is no guidance as to
what ­factors (e.g., feasibility or cost) should be considered in determining
whether the criteria are met (IOM, 2006; IPPC, 2008; Rothstein, 2005).
HHS commentary in the December 2000 Final Rule briefly mentioned cost
as one factor that could be considered in determining practicability41 (HHS,
2000), but guidance documents do not define what is “practicable” or
“impracticable.” As a result, institutions apply varying standards independently, often too conservatively to allow even low-risk research to proceed
(see also Chapter 5). For example, some institutions interpret impracticable
as “not at all possible” and require researchers to demonstrate that a study
will fail without a waiver of authorization.
Moreover, stakeholders across the board, from researchers to indi­vidual
patients, have questioned the meaning of the “practicability” standard (Pritts
et al., 2008; Tovino, 2004). One focus group study indicated that patients
may find it appropriate to consider two factors in determining whether it
is practicable to conduct the research without the waiver of authorization:
whether having to contact each patient first would (1) make the study less
scientifically valid or (2) make the results less useful in improving medical
care (i.e., would produce selection bias) (Pritts et al., 2008).
There are also no clear standards regarding what constitutes adequate
protection of privacy, or what constitutes a minimal risk to privacy. The
concept of minimal risk implies that there is a risk threshold, above which
protections should be stricter. However, clearly defining the threshold is
problematic. The terms “adequate plan” and “adequate written assurance”
are highly subjective, and thus different institutions are likely to set varying
thresholds for “minimal risk.” Thus, to facilitate appropriate authorization requirements for responsible research, the committee recommends
that HHS simplify the criteria that IRBs and Privacy Boards use in making
determinations for when they can waive the requirements to obtain authorization from each patient whose PHI will be used for a research study.
In the 2000 version of the Privacy Rule, one of the criteria for waiver
of authorization was that “the privacy risks to individuals whose PHI is to
be used or disclosed are reasonable in relation to the anticipated benefits, if
any, to the individual, and the importance of the knowledge that may rea40 See 45 C.F.R. § 116(d) (2005).

sonably be expected to result from the research.”42 In 2002, HHS deleted
this criterion from the Final Rule, stating that it was “unnecessarily duplicative of other provisions to protect patients’ confidentiality interests.”43
It may have been more appropriate to retain this criterion and omit the
criteria for impracticability.
If the current waiver criteria are to be retained, the IOM committee
believes that a clear and reasonable definition of practicability, along with
specific case examples of what should or should not be considered impracticable or of minimal risk, could perhaps reduce variability and overly
conservative interpretation of these provisions.
Simplification or clarification of the waiver criteria would be especially
helpful for multi-institutional studies, which fall under the jurisdiction of
multiple IRBs or Privacy Boards. Covered entities are permitted to rely on
a waiver of authorization approved by a single IRB or Privacy Board with
jurisdiction. However, covered entities often decide to require approval
from their own IRB or Privacy Board prior to disclosing PHI to the requesting researcher, regardless of whether another IRB or Privacy Board already
granted a waiver of authorization. This leads to delays and variability in the
protocol at different sites (see also Chapter 5). Simplification would also be
very helpful for smaller or community-based institutions that do not have
internal counsel or regulatory affairs specialists, and are thus more likely to
opt out of research that requires decisions about authorizations.
Activities Preparatory to Research
A second situation where a covered entity is permitted to use and disclose
PHI without obtaining authorization is for activities that are preparatory
to research.44 Review by an IRB or a Privacy Board is also not required for
activities preparatory to research. A covered entity may permit researchers to
look through its medical records in order to develop research protocols and
to aid the recruitment of research participants if it obtains from the researcher
representations that the information sought is necessary for the research purpose, that information will be reviewed only for the stated purposes preparatory to research, and that no PHI will be removed from the covered entity by
the researcher in the course of the review45 (HHS, 2004a,c).
Many research studies, especially those focused on rare conditions
with limited eligible patient populations, rely on large-scale medical chart
reviews and searches of patient databases to identify patients who might

be eligible for and might benefit from a particular study. Sufficient patient
enrollment in a timely fashion is essential to ensure the meaningfulness and
reliability of the research results. However, confusion regarding what is permitted under this component of the Privacy Rule is widespread (SACHRP,
2004), and surveys and studies indicate that patient recruitment has become
more difficult and costly under the varying interpretations of the Privacy
Rule (see Chapter 5).
HHS has issued multiple guidance statements on this topic, but these
statements, some of which have been contradictory, have failed to eliminate
confusion (reviewed by SACHRP, 2004). According to current HHS guidance on the Privacy Rule, researchers (both internal and external to a covered entity) may conduct a review of medical records under the preparatory
to research exception. However, only internal researchers (an employee or
member of the covered entity’s workforce) may contact potential subjects
about the possibility of enrolling in a study under this provision of the
Privacy Rule. HHS guidance on the Privacy Rule indicates that external
researchers are not allowed under the preparatory to research exception
to record or remove contact information of patients from a covered entity.
External researchers must get an IRB/Privacy Board approved waiver of
authorization to perform any recruitment activities. This creates an artificial distinction between internal and external researchers that actually
provides less privacy protection than that afforded by the Common Rule,
which requires that any activities preparatory to research involving human
subjects, or related to initial recruitment of subjects for research studies, be
reviewed and approved by an IRB (HHS, 2003). Thus, the Privacy Rule permits conduct that is prohibited by the Common Rule (Rothstein, 2005).
IRBs historically have required all communications about an available research study to come from the individual’s caregivers, not from an
investigator unknown to the potential subjects (SACHRP, 2004). Moreover,
research shows that patients prefer to be approached by their clinician or an
associated nurse as opposed to a stranger (­Damschroder et al., 2007; Kass
et al., 2003; Robling et al., 2004; Westin, 2007; Willison et al., 2007), and
HHS has reported that most allegations of violations of the Privacy Rule
related to research come from patients upset at receiving recruitment calls
from unknown researchers (Heide, 2007).
According to the Secretary’s Advisory Committee on Human Research
Protections (SACHRP), “The consequence of these confused and complex
interpretations of research recruitment requirements has been to layer unnecessary, and extremely burdensome, tasks onto human subjects research. It
appears, for example, that in some institutions, boilerplate business associate
contracts are being signed, and that template applications for partial ­waivers
of authorization are being routinely granted, as methods of perfunctory
compliance with these confusing Privacy Rule requirements. Another effect

BEYOND THE HIPAA PRIVACY RULE

of the enormous confusion has been that other institutions are hesitant to
permit many recruitment activities critical to the continuation of the research
enterprise, out of fear that they are in some way misinterpreting the government’s current positions on research recruitment. SACHRP is very concerned
that the bureaucratic complexities here undermine, rather than enhance, the
attention that needs to be paid to the welfare and interests of subjects in the
research recruitment process” (SACHRP, 2004).
The IOM committee believes that new guidance documents from HHS
that clarify and simplify the rules for activities preparatory to research,
and harmonize them with the Common Rule—by requiring IRB/Privacy
Board approval for all researchers (internal and external) prior to contacting potential subjects—would help to eliminate this confusion and facilitate
ethical research that protects patient privacy.
Research on Protected Health Information of Decedents
The third situation where a covered entity is permitted to disclose PHI
without authorization is for research using the PHI of decedents. Covered
entities are not required to obtain authorization from the personal representative or next of kin to conduct research on a decedent’s PHI, nor are
they required to receive a waiver of authorization. These provisions are
similar to the Common Rule, which defines a “human subject” as a “living
individual.”46
However, the Privacy Rule does require that researchers make several
representations, either in writing or orally, to the covered entity prior to
the covered entity granting the researcher access to a decedent’s PHI. These
representations include:
•
•
•

The use or disclosure being sought is solely for research on the PHI
of decedents
The PHI is necessary for research
The death of the individual is documented, if requested by the
covered entity47

Apparently some covered entities interpret the Privacy Rule more conservatively by requiring researchers to obtain authorization from next of
kin, or a waiver of authorization from an IRB or Privacy Board, in order
to access the PHI of decedents (Ness, 2007).48

173

Deidentified Information
Researchers can also access deidentified health information stored by
covered entities without obtaining authorization, waiver of authorization,
or IRB/Privacy Board approval. Deidentified information does not qualify
as PHI, and therefore is not protected under the Privacy Rule—it can be
disclosed to researchers at any time (HHS, 2004c). The Privacy Rule offers
two methods to deidentify personal health information. Under the statistical method, a statistician or person with appropriate training verifies that
enough identifiers have been removed that the risk of identification of the
individual is very small. Under the “safe harbor” method, data are considered deidentified if the covered entity removes 18 specified personal identifiers from the data (Box 4-4).49 In the process of deidentifying information,
the covered entity may assign a code to the deidentified information so
that it may reidentify it, but the code may not be derived from information
related to the individual (e.g., Social Security number). Furthermore, the
covered entity may not disclose the key to the code to anyone else.50 These
provisions of the Privacy Rule are based on the federal statistical agencies’
policy of using statistical methods to assess and protect the confidentiality
of individuals’ data they collect and release (Interagency Confidentiality
and Data Access Group, 1999; Subcommittee on Disclosure Limitation
Methodology, 1994).
These provisions are more stringent than those of the Common Rule,
leading to situations in which some coded data might be subject to the
Privacy Rule, but not the Common Rule (Rothstein, 2005). The Common
Rule does not apply to research if “the identity of the subject is [not] or
may [not] be readily ascertained by the investigator or associated with the
information accessed by the researcher” (see Chapter 3).51 In practice,
this can mean that a covered entity may no longer routinely disclose for
research data that have been anonymized according to the Common Rule
(Pritts, 2008). This discrepancy between deidentification standards under
the two rules can give rise to situations in which research with anonymized
data that are exempt from IRB oversight under the Common Rule may still
require a decision by an IRB or a Privacy Board to determine if a waiver of
individuals’ authorization of disclosure for the use of their information for
research purposes is appropriate under the Privacy Rule. But because IRBs
have not had to review these protocols in the past, they may find it difficult
to make appropriate decisions about waivers.
The Privacy Rule restrictions put greater emphasis on the possibility
that health data could be reidentified using publicly available databases.

members of the individual must be removed from medical record information in
order for the records to be considered deidentified:
1. Names.
2. All geographical subdivisions smaller than a state, including street address,

the initial three digits of a ZIP Code, if according to the current publicly available data from the Bureau of the Census: (1) the geographic unit formed
by combining all ZIP Codes with the same three initial digits contains more
than 20,000 people; and (2) the initial three digits of a ZIP Code for all such
geographic units containing 20,000 or fewer people is changed to 000.
3. All elements of dates (except year) for dates directly related to an individual
(including birth date, admission date, discharge date, date of death) and all
ages over 89 and all elements of dates (including year) indicative of such
age, except that such ages and elements may be aggregated into a single
category of age 90 or older.

Determining what information can be released without inappropriately

statistical issue (Fienberg, 2005) (see also discussion on privacy-­preserving
data mining and statistical disclosure limitation in Chapter 2). Record

public list searches are readily available for integration with “deidentified”
data, making it easier to reidentify data than when the Common Rule was
implemented (De Wolf et al., 2006; Pritts, 2008). For example, an academic
exercise showed that it was possible to identify the names and addresses
of 97 percent of the registered voters in Cambridge, Massachusetts, using
the birth date and full postal code (Sweeney, 1997). In a nonacademic setting, New York Times reporters were also able to identify “anonymous”
AOL clients whose search habits had been posted on the web for research
projects by linking their search history to other available data (Barbarq
and Zeller, 2006).
Studies indicate that even after removal of the 18 identifiers required
under the safe harbor method of the Privacy Rule, recipients could reidentify individuals in a study dataset with a moderately high expectation of
accuracy by applying only diagnosis and medication combinations (Clause
et al., 2004). In short, even the Privacy Rule’s deidentification standard may
not be stringent enough to protect the anonymity of data in today’s technological environment (Pritts, 2008). However, strong security measures
(as recommended in Chapter 2) and the implementation of legal sanctions
against the unauthorized reidentification of deidentified data (as recommended in subsequent sections of this chapter) may be more effective in
protecting privacy than more stringent deidentification standards.
Limited Datasets
Many researchers have argued that removal of all 18 data categories as
required by the HIPAA Privacy Rule’s deidentification standards can render
the dataset unusable for many research projects (Casarett et al., 2005; HHS,
2002; Kulynych and Korn, 2002; SACHRP, 2004) (see also Chapter 5).52
For example, general areas of origin, residence, and work may be essential
to epidemiological and other studies of topics such as disease incidence.
Likewise, treatment dates are essential information for determining treatment effects, including adverse side effects. Concerns were also raised
that deidentification would impede longitudinal studies, and subsequent
research has indicated that information deidentified using the safe harbor
method of removing all of the listed identifiers results in lost chronological
spacing of episodes of care (Clause et al., 2004).
Because of these concerns, some stakeholders urged HHS “to permit
covered entities to disclose PHI for research if the protected information
is facially deidentified, that is, stripped of direct identifiers, so long as the
research entity provides assurances that it will not use or disclose the information for purposes other than research and will not identify or contact

the individuals who are subjects of the information.”53 Others were more
specific and requested that the Privacy Rule be amended to allow the use
of keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC), asserting that this
mechanism would be valuable for researchers because it allows the recipient
to link clinical information about the individual from multiple entities over
time. In direct response to these requests, HHS modified the Privacy Rule
and created a category54 of partially deidentified data called the “limited
dataset,” which may be used and disclosed for research without obtaining
individual authorization or IRB/Privacy Board approval.55
To qualify as a limited dataset, 16 of the more direct identifiers—
such as names, addresses, Social Security numbers, and medical telephone
­numbers—must be removed from the data. However, the following elements may be included in a limited dataset: city, state, ZIP Code, elements
of date, and other numbers, characteristics, or codes not listed as direct
identifiers in the regulation (including HMAC). A limited dataset may be
created by a covered entity or the covered entity can enter into a business
associate agreement with another party, including the intended recipient, to
create the limited dataset on its behalf.56
To disclose a limited dataset for research without individual authorization, the covered entity must enter into a data use agreement with the
recipient. These contracts specify the recipient of the limited dataset and
require the recipient to agree to a number of conditions, including:
•
•
•
•
•

Not to use or disclose the limited dataset other than as permitted
by the agreement or as required by law
To use appropriate safeguards to prevent the use or disclosure of the
information other than as provided for in the data use agreement
To report to the covered entity any use or disclosure of the information not provided for by the data use agreement of which the
recipient becomes aware
To ensure that any agents to whom the recipient provides the limited dataset agree to the same restrictions and conditions as the
original recipient
Not to identify the information or contact the individuals whose
records are included in the dataset57

Although some researchers have indicated that the use of limited datasets may be “enticing” (Pace et al., 2005), there do not appear to be any
studies about the use of limited datasets in the United States (Pritts, 2008).
France reportedly uses the equivalent of limited datasets from numerous
hospitals to conduct epidemiologic research (Berman, 2002), but the French
health care system and legal environment are quite different than in the
United States. In testimony at an Institute of Medicine workshop on the
HIPAA Privacy Rule and health research, legal experts noted the shortcomings of the limited dataset (IOM, 2006). For example, in some health care
settings, it can be challenging to identify an individual who will sign a data
use agreement on behalf of the covered entity and thus manage the contract
according to the perceived risk and obligation to monitor how that limited dataset is used. At the other extreme, it was noted that some covered
entities were signing data use agreements as a matter of course, and thus
providing little meaningful privacy protection to the patient (IOM, 2006).
Thus, the committee recommends that HHS encourage greater use of
limited datasets and develop clear guidance on how to set up and comply
with the associated data use agreements more efficiently and effectively.
Linking Data from Multiple Sources
A single database may not provide a complete picture of a patient’s condition or health history, so combining information from multiple sources
is often necessary (IOM, 2000). HHS stated that one intent of the limited
dataset provisions was to permit data to be used and disclosed in a coded
manner such that the recipient of the data could link one person’s data
longitudinally over multiple settings.58 However, linking data continues to
be problematic for researchers under the HIPAA Privacy Rule (IOM, 2006;
IPPC, 2008).
The Privacy Rule addresses data aggregation only with respect to
health care operations,59 not research. However, it is possible in principle under the Privacy Rule for a researcher to aggregate PHI from
multiple covered entities with authorization or IRB/Privacy Board waiver
of authorization. Obtaining individuals’ authorization for research that
entails the review of thousands of medical records is unrealistic, though,
and even with a waiver of authorization, covered entities with large
datasets are often reluctant to allow researchers access to PHI, as noted
above (see also Chapters 5 and 6). More commonly, data are provided
to researchers with direct identifiers removed. But because datasets from
multiple sources cannot be linked to generate a more complete record of

a patient’s health history without a unique identifier, such datasets often
are of minimal value to researchers and are not frequently used. A third
party may also collect PHI from covered entities and aggregate the data
for research by establishing business associate agreements (BAs) with
the various data sources, but in practice, BAs are used infrequently for
this purpose (AcademyHealth, 2008). This approach is complicated and
impractical to set up for individual research projects. Moreover, BAs can
be established by covered entities to gain competitive advantage, rather
than to collaborate in research.
The committee believes that a better approach would be to establish
secure, trusted, nonconflicted intermediaries that could develop a protocol,
or key, for routinely linking data without direct identifiers from different
sources and then provide more complete and useful deidentified datasets to
researchers. One way this could be accomplished, for example, might be
through data warehouses that are certified for the purpose of linking data
from different sources (IOM, 2000). The organizations responsible for such
linking would be required to use strong security measures and would maintain the details about how this linkage was done, should another research
team need to recreate the linked dataset. Using such intermediaries would
increase patient privacy protections and allay concerns of covered entities,
and thus would facilitate greater use of health data for research and also
lead to more meaningful study results.
CMS provides a similar service for Medicare and Medicaid data, via
contractors who create standardized data files that are tailored for research
(Box 4-5). The agency has begun pilot projects to aggregate Medicare claims
data with data from commercial health plans and, in some cases, Medicaid,
in order to calculate and report quality measures for physician groups. A
broader effort to link data from diverse sources has been initiated by the
Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), called the National
Health Data Stewardship Entity.60 AHRQ is also involved in implementing
the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005, which encourages
creation of Patient Safety Organizations to receive information from hospitals, doctors, and health care providers on a privileged and confidential
basis, for analysis and aggregation.61 Although the purpose of the latter two
initiatives is for monitoring health care quality, they could provide a model
for data aggregation applicable to health research as well.
The HIPAA administrative simplification provisions specifically provided for the creation of a unique individual identifier, but work on this
project has been halted because there is a great deal of controversy regarding how it could be implemented without comprising individual privacy.

BOX 4-5
The Chronic Conditions Warehouse
Section 723 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 instructed the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services to make Medicare data more readily available to researchers
studying chronic illness in the Medicare population, with the intent to help “identify
areas for improving the quality of care provided to chronically ill Medicare beneficiaries, [and] reduce program spending.” The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
Services (CMS) contracted with the Iowa Foundation for Medical Care to create
the Chronic Conditions Warehouse (CCW) to implement the requirements of the
Act.
The Data: The CCW contains fee-for-services claims, enrollment/eligibility,
and assessment data. Researchers can efficiently access data on 21 predefined
chronic health conditions, such as diabetes, breast cancer, Alzheimer’s, and
depression. Data files can also be extracted for other cohorts on request. Every
data file includes a unique, encrypted CCW beneficiary identifier that allows the
researcher to link a beneficiary’s data across data sources and types within the
CCW system.
The Process: A researcher must submit to CMS a data release request that
includes a research design and objectives, which are reviewed by a CMS Privacy
Board to ensure that the project will assist CMS “in monitoring, managing, and
improving the Medicare and Medicaid programs or the services provided to beneficiaries.” The Privacy Board is instructed to “balance the potential risks to the
beneficiary confidentiality with the probable benefits gained from the completed
research,” as well as to consider the researchers’ demonstrated expertise and
experience in conducting such a study.
Once the request for data release is approved, the researcher must sign a
CMS data use agreement that describes how the data can be used and how the
data should be destroyed or returned to CMS at the conclusion of the study. If a
researcher wishes to publish the study results, the manuscript must be submitted
to CMS for review prior to publication to ensure that the privacy of all beneficiaries
is maintained.
SOURCES: CMS (2008); IFMC (2008).

Federal agencies are also under pressure from the Office of Management
and Budget to reduce the use of Social Security numbers as unique identifiers. But the development of some type of linking key (not based on Social
Security numbers) would make linkages more efficient, standardized, and
reliable and less costly. Moreover, this type of linkage could greatly facilitate many types of information research, provide more extensive health
histories and facilitate public health surveillance, and improve quality of
care (HHS, 1998; Hillestad et al., 2008).

Genetic Information and the Privacy Rule
Research involving genetic information presents perhaps some of the
most challenging areas for protecting the privacy of health information
(Bregman-Eschet, 2006; Farmer and Godard, 2007; Greely, 2007; NBAC,
1999). With recent technological advances in biomedical research, it is
now possible to learn a great deal about disease processes and individual variations in treatment effectiveness or susceptibility to disease from
genetic analyses because the DNA sequences comprising a person’s genome
strongly influence a person’s health. New knowledge of the human genome,
combined with advances in computing capabilities, are expected to help
decipher the roles that genetics and the environment play in the origins of
complex but common human diseases, such as cancer, heart disease, and
diabetes. In this genomic age of health research, patient samples stored
in biospecimen banks can provide a wealth of information for addressing
long-standing questions about health and disease, and efforts are underway
to create large genomic databases for that purpose (Adams, 2008; Greely,
2007; Lowrance, 2002; Lowrance and Collins, 2007). However, it is particularly difficult to assess the potential harms to individuals who are the
subjects of research in these rapidly advancing areas (NBAC, 1999; Pritts,
2008), and precedent does not appear to provide sufficient guidance in
this relatively uncharted territory (Lowrance, 2002; Lowrance and Collins,
2007). Moreover, HHS has not issued clear guidance on how the Privacy
Rule applies to DNA samples or sequences (IOM, 2005).
HHS guidance documents indicate that tissue or blood itself is not
protected under the Privacy Rule unless it contains or is associated with
HIPAA identifiers (HHS, 2004b). HHS has further stated that the results of
an analysis of blood or tissue, if containing or associated with personally
identifiable information, would be PHI. However, the research community
remains uncertain about whether genetic information accompanying biospecimens is protected under the Privacy Rule because the list of identifiers
includes “biometric identifiers” and “unique identifying characteristics”62
(NCVHS, 2004).
The European Union, which has a more restrictive privacy regime than
the United States, does not consider DNA in and of itself to be a direct
identifier (DPWP, 2007). Genetic information does not itself identify an
individual in the absence of other identifying information. However, in
some circumstances, a ­person’s genetic code could be construed as a unique
identifier in that it could be used to match a sequence in another biospecimen bank or databank that does include identifiers (Lin et al., 2004; Malin
and Sweeney, 2004).

As genetic information becomes more prevalent in research and health
care, the latter scenario is more likely to occur. For example, in January
2008, the NIH began requiring data from the Genome Wide Association Study63 to be submitted to a central databank in an anonymous and
aggregated form. That database was publicly accessible until August 2008
when officials at NIH removed the database from the public Website, citing concerns about patient confidentiality (Couzin, 2008; Zerhouni and
Nabel, 2008). Those concerns stemmed from a study showing that a new
type of DNA analysis could confirm the identity of an individual in a pool
of similarly masked data if that person’s genetic profile was already known
(Homer et al., 2008). NIH intends to move the aggregate genotype data to
a secure, controlled-access database with policies for review and approval
of data access requests (Zerhouni and Nabel, 2008).
Also, as we enter the era of personalized medicine, genetic information is more likely to be included in a person’s health records. But at
the same time, realization of the promises of personalized medicine will
require research on DNA from a great many diverse individuals whose
medical histories are well documented. Therefore, the committee believes
that the establishment of consistent standards for use and protection of
genetic information is important and advocates a focus on strong security
measures. To facilitate appropriate use of DNA in health research, the
committee recommends that HHS clarify the circumstances under which
DNA samples or sequences are considered PHI. In addition, it recommends
the adoption of strict prohibitions on the unauthorized ­reidentification of
individuals by anyone from DNA sequences.
Regardless of how genetic information is regulated under the HIPAA
Privacy Rule, a federal prohibition of genetic discrimination is necessary
to allay privacy concerns and diminish potential negative consequences of
unintended disclosure of genetic information. Many people are concerned
about genetic discrimination—the misuse of genetic information by insurance companies, employers, and others to make decisions based on a
person’s DNA—so it is important both to protect the privacy of genetic
information and to protect people against such discrimination. The Genetic
Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), recently signed into law, hopefully will begin to address some of these concerns.
Accounting of Research Disclosures
The “accounting of disclosures” provision of the HIPAA ­Privacy Rule
gives individuals the right to receive a list of certain disclosures that a covered entity has made of their PHI in the past 6 years, including disclosures
63 See http://www.genome.gov/20019523/.

Beyond the HIPAA Privacy Rule: Enhancing Privacy, Improving Health Through Research

BEYOND THE HIPAA PRIVACY RULE

made for research purposes.64 The accounting of disclosures (AOD) must
also include certain substantive information related to each disclosure,
including the date of the disclosure, the identity of the person who received
the information, a description of the information disclosed, and a statement
of the purpose of the disclosure.
The AOD requirement was intended “as a means for the individual to
find out the nonroutine purposes for which his or her PHI was disclosed by
the covered entity, so as to increase the individual’s awareness of persons
or entities other than the individual’s health care provider or health plan
in possession of this information.”65 This requirement does not actually
protect privacy; it merely requires covered entities to record disclosures
that have already happened. In addition, the AOD requirement does not
constitute an audit trail, as there are numerous exceptions to the requirement, including disclosures for health care operations, pursuant to an
authorization, as part of a limited dataset, for national security or intelligence purposes, and to correctional institutions or law enforcement official.
Therefore, AOD cannot provide individuals with some of the information
they may want, such as a list of employees who looked at their medical
record when they were in the hospital (AHIC, 2007; Pritts, 2008).
Disclosures made for research purposes under a waiver of authorization, or for public health purposes as required by law, must be included in
the AOD. In fact, HHS has noted that “making a set of records available
for review by a third party constitutes a disclosure of the PHI in the entire
set of records, regardless of whether the third party actually reviews any
particular record.” The Privacy Rule has an exception for research involving groups of 50 or more subjects, which allows the generation of a general
list of all protocols for which a person’s PHI may have been disclosed, but
even in that case, there is a considerable administrative obligation. Furthermore, in many medical facilities, that list is very extensive, and thus is
relatively meaningless to a particular patient.
This aspect of the Privacy Rule places a heavy administrative burden
on health systems and health services research that achieves little in terms
of protecting privacy. Moreover, HHS has not given covered entities any
guidance on practical ways to fulfill this requirement in an efficient manner.
Annual surveys of health care privacy officers undertaken by the American
Health Information Management Association (AHIMA) since 2004 have
found that many facilities report difficulties with the AOD requirement
(AHIMA, 2006). Furthermore, the surveys have found that the demand
for AOD is extremely low. Two-thirds of respondents reported receiving no
requests at all. Nearly a third indicated that they would like to see a change

to the AOD provisions—the most frequently cited Privacy Rule provision
among all respondents, and by far among those with more than 20,000
admissions/discharges per year. Based on these results, AHIMA concluded
that “for many, this provision is not only burdensome but also significantly
inefficient.”
The National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics (NCVHS), the
Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), and SACHRP have all
recommended changes to the AOD provisions (see Appendix A). Witnesses
at the first public hearing held by the NCVHS Subcommittee on Privacy and
Confidentiality, held in August 2001, suggested that covered entities were
likely to refuse to share PHI because of the burden of the AOD provisions.
NCVHS stated that it supported an individual’s right to an AOD, but suggested that HHS issue guidance to provide covered entities with ways to
fulfill this requirement in a convenient and practical manner. To date, no
efforts have been undertaken to identify organizations that have successfully implemented the AOD requirement, or the practices that they have
put in place (Pritts, 2008).
Case reports gathered for AAMC’s database also indicated that this provision is a tremendous burden to providers and researchers and has resulted
in many covered entities refusing to make PHI available to ­ researchers.
AAMC recommended that the AOD requirement be eliminated for research,
if IRB/Privacy Board approval is given, asserting that most AOD do not
provide any meaningful information to the individual and that it would be
better to investigate any questionable disclosures as they occur.
SACHRP made a similar recommendation, stating that the Privacy Rule
imposes sufficient privacy protections without applying this portion of the
Privacy Rule to research. Indeed, SACHRP concluded that the cost and
burden of compliance with AOD requirements was so high that institutions
were likely to accept the risk of noncompliance rather than incur the cost
of compliance. Noting that researchers must establish a certain standard of
privacy protections before an IRB or a Privacy Board will grant a waiver of
authorization, or before a covered entity will permit a researcher to access
PHI preparatory to research, SACHRP recommended that covered entities
should inform patients in the HIPAA “Notice of Privacy Practices” that
their PHI may be used and disclosed for research purposes without their
authorization if sufficient privacy safeguards are in place. The IOM committee concurs, and recommends that HHS reform the requirements for the
accounting of disclosures of protected health information for research. In
the interest of transparency, institutions should maintain a list, accessible
to the public, of all studies approved by an IRB or Privacy Board, in place
of the AOD requirement. However, as the health care system moves toward
broader implementation of electronic health records, automatic tracking of
audit trails will be an important component to incorporate.

Enforcement of the Privacy Rule
The Privacy Rule sets out both civil and criminal penalties for covered
entities that breach the Rule.66 The civil penalty provision allows a $100
fine per violation for disclosure made in error, with a maximum fine of up to
$25,000 per year. The criminal penalties for persons who knowingly obtain
or disclose personally identifiable information include fines of up to $50,000
and imprisonment for up to 1 year. If the crime is committed under false
pretenses, the individual or organization faces fines up to $100,000 and 5
years of imprisonment. Penalties for the sale or use of PHI for commercial
advantage, personal gain, or malicious harm are fines of up to $250,000 and
10 years of imprisonment.
The Privacy Rule does not provide for a private right of action by
patients or research participants.67 Thus, an individual whose privacy is
violated under the Privacy Rule cannot sue the covered entity or individual
who breached his or her privacy. Rather, an individual can file a claim with
HHS’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR). OCR is in charge of enforcement and
decides whether and when to pursue a regulatory investigation and penalties against a covered entity (Stevens, 2003). In addition, it is important to
note that this does not prevent an individual from pursuing a private right
of action under state law (Pritts, 2008).
The Compliance and Enforcement regulations stress cooperative compliance over the imposition of penalties (reviewed by Pritts, 2008). The
regulations specifically provide that the Secretary will, to the extent practicable, seek the cooperation of the covered entity in obtaining compliance.68
If an investigation indicates a failure to comply, the regulations provide that
the Secretary will first attempt to resolve the matter by informal means.69
Such informal resolutions include demonstrating compliance, a completed
corrective action plan, or a resolution agreement (HHS, 2007).70 Only if a
covered entity does not take action to resolve the noncompliance will HHS
contemplate imposing civil monetary penalties on the covered entity.71

Also, a covered entity that is itself in compliance with the Privacy Rule
will not be held liable for the actions of a business associate that breaches
the terms of its business associate agreement. A covered entity that knows
of a pattern of activity or practice of a business associate that constitutes a
material breach of its contract must take reasonable steps to cure the breach
or end the violation.72 If such efforts are unsuccessful, the covered entity must
terminate the contract if feasible.73 If termination is not feasible, the covered
entity must report the problem to the Secretary.74 So long as a covered entity
complies with these procedures, it is not liable for the actions of its business
associates and will not be assessed civil monetary penalties (HHS, 2006).75
Between April 2003 and March 2008, OCR received more than 33,000
complaints alleging violations of the Privacy Rule (Barr, 2008). Most of the
complaints have been filed against health care providers, including physician practices, general hospitals, pharmacies, and outpatient clinics, and
largely deal with health information uses, disclosures, and safeguards. The
number of complaints OCR has received that relate to research is unclear
(NCVHS, 2005). In the majority of cases, OCR determined that the complaint did not present an eligible case for enforcement, either because OCR
lacked jurisdiction, the complaint was untimely, or the activity did not
violate the Privacy Rule.
To date, there have been no civil penalties imposed against any covered entity for breaching the Privacy Rule. Similarly, there have only been
three criminal prosecutions under the Privacy Rule of indi­viduals involved
in medical identity theft (Rahman, 2006).76 In spite of this enforcement
record, many covered entities remain hesitant to share health information
due to concerns about liability (Pritts, 2008).
In surveys, many providers and payors self-report that they are not in
compliance with the Privacy Rule. In a recent survey by Phoenix Health
Systems, 20 percent of providers and 13 percent of payors reported that
they have had insufficient incentives to incur the cost of implementing all
the requirements of the Privacy Rule. In the survey, none of the participating providers was able to show that it had complied with every provision
of the Privacy Rule. Payors only reported doing marginally better (Phoenix
Health Systems, 2006). In surveys by AHIMA, about 40 percent of hospitals and health systems reported full compliance with HIPAA regulations,
while about 15 percent believed they were less than 85 percent compliant
(AHIMA, 2006). More than half the respondents indicated that resources

were the most significant barrier to full privacy compliance, noting a particular need to support education and training of new staff.
Relationship between HIPAA and Other Laws
Federal Research Statutes
Several other federal statutes regulate research and affect the types of
research projects that can be carried out in the United States. The federal
regulations most relevant to health research are the Common Rule77 and
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Protection of Human Subjects
Regulations, which have similar origins and intent78 (see Chapter 3). Both
the Common Rule and the FDA regulations are concerned primarily with
the physical risks to humans associated with participation in a research
study. Neither set of regulations provides detailed and prescriptive regulations for the protection of privacy (HHS, 2002). Nonetheless, there are
numerous instances in which the Privacy Rule and the Common Rule
diverge, as described above.
General Federal Laws
The Privacy Rule also often interacts with other federal laws. In the
preamble to the Privacy Rule, HHS stated that there should be few instances
where the Privacy Rule conflicts with existing statutes or regulations. Where
potential conflicts do exist, HHS stated that an attempt should be made
to resolve the conflict so that both laws apply. For example, if a statute or
regulation permits the dissemination of PHI, but the Privacy Rule ­prohibits
the use or disclosure of PHI without authorization, the covered entity is
able to comply with both sets of laws. The entity could obtain HIPAA
authorization prior to disseminating the information as permitted by the
other law (HHS, 2000).
The fact that a covered entity is permitted to use or disclose PHI “as
required by law” under the Privacy Rule reduces a number of potential
conflicts between the Privacy Rule and other federal rules.79 HHS provided an example to explain this point. If a previous statute or regulation
requires a specific use or disclosure of PHI that the Privacy Rule appears
to prohibit, the section of the Privacy Rule that permits uses or disclosures
“as required by law” would allow this disclosure to be made. Also, HHS
specifically stated that if a statute or regulation prohibits a use or disclo77 See 45 C.F.R. part 46(a) (2005).
78 See 21 C.F.R. parts 50 and 56 (2008).

187

sure of PHI that the Privacy Rule permits, the earlier, more specific statute
applies (HHS, 2000).
As a result, covered entities are often subject to both the Privacy Rule
and other federal statutes and regulations simultaneously. In many situations, researchers must comply with the Privacy Rule and the Common
Rule or the FDA Protection of Human Subjects Regulations. Medicare
providers must comply with the requirements of the Privacy Rule and the
Privacy Act of 1974. Health care providers in schools, colleges, and universities must comply with the Privacy Rule and the Family Educational
Rights and Privacy Act. Substance abuse treatment facilities must comply
with the Privacy Rule and the Substance Abuse Confidentiality provisions
of the Public Health Service Act, Section 543 and its regulations. There are
innumerable examples where the Privacy Rule and another federal statute
both must be followed (HHS, 2000).
State Laws
Similar to the Privacy Rule’s relationship to other federal statutes, the
relationship between the Privacy Rule and state privacy laws is also complicated. In general, the Privacy Rule preempts contrary state laws relating to the privacy of health information. Generally, this means that if it is
impossible for a covered entity to comply with both the Privacy Rule and
the state law in question, the Privacy Rule will be applied in the situation
and the state law will be considered void.80
This general rule has three exceptions. First, any state law that is not
contrary to the Privacy Rule is not preempted. If it is possible for a covered
entity to comply with both the Privacy Rule and the state law simultaneously, there is no preemption of the state law, and the covered entity must
comply with both sets of privacy rules.
Second, state laws that are contrary to the Privacy Rule, but provide
more protection to the privacy of health information, are not preempted by
the Privacy Rule. The Privacy Rule sets a national floor for the protection
of PHI, not a national ceiling. More stringent means that the state law:
(1) prohibits or restricts a use or disclosure in circumstances that would be
permitted under HIPAA; (2) permits greater rights of access or amendment
for the individual who is the subject of the PHI; (3) provides an individual
with a greater amount of information regarding disclosure, rights, and remedies; (4) narrows the scope or duration of any legal permission to use PHI,
or increases the privacy protections afforded to PHI; (5) provides for the
retention or reporting of more detailed information for longer durations;

or (6) provides greater privacy protection for the individual with respect
to any other matter.
The third exception to the general preemption rule is in the public
health arena. State laws that are contrary to the Privacy Rule—but provide
for the reporting of disease or injury, child abuse, birth, or death, or for
conducting public health surveillance, investigation, and intervention—are
not preempted by the Privacy Rule. States are permitted to set their own
rules regarding what type of information can be collected by public health
agents and how that information is used (HHS, 2004c).
Applying this preemption rule and determining what privacy laws must
be followed in any given state can be a difficult task for covered entities.
All states provide some protection for the privacy of health information.
However, they differ greatly in what type of protection they provide, and
thus, interact differently with the federal Privacy Rule. To successfully
conduct a preemption analysis, a covered entity must become familiar with
both the state laws and the Privacy Rule, interpret how the state and federal
regulations interact with each other, and correctly determine the situations
in which the Privacy Rule preempts state law. Many of the provisions in
the Privacy Rule do not have directly corresponding provisions in state
laws. This makes comparing the two sets of rules a technical and tedious
task. One of the main impediments to a covered entity complying with the
Privacy Rule is likely the lack of understanding of what the Privacy Rule
actually requires in each state (Pritts, 2002).
Conclusions and recommendations
The HIPAA Privacy Rule was written to provide consistent standards
in the United States for the use and disclosure of PHI by covered entities,
including the use and disclosure of such information for research purposes.
In its current state, however, the HIPAA Privacy Rule is difficult to reconcile
with other federal regulations, including HHS regulations for the protection of human subjects (the Common Rule), FDA regulations pertaining to
human subjects,81 and other applicable federal or state laws.
Inconsistencies, for example, in federal regulations and their interpretations governing the deidentification of personal health information,
obtaining individuals’ consent for future research, and the recruitment of
research volunteers make it challenging for health researchers seeking to
comply with all these regulations to undertake important research activities.
In addition, there is substantial variation in the way in which institutions
interpret and apply the Privacy Rule (see also Chapter 5).
Additional guidance from HHS, along with some changes in interpreta81 See 21 C.F.R. parts 50 and 56 (2008).

tion by HHS, would reduce misunderstandings of the Privacy Rule provisions by covered entities, IRBs, and Privacy Boards and help to harmonize
federal regulations governing health research, which would in turn reduce
complexity for researchers and covered entities, and thereby help to ensure
consistent and appropriate privacy protections for patients. Thus, HHS
should develop revised and expanded guidance materials for the Privacy
Rule.
For example, HHS should develop guidance to clearly state that future
research with repositories can go forward under the Privacy Rule with
IRB/Privacy Board oversight. Many institutions create and maintain databases with patient health information as well as repositories with biological
materials collected from patients, and use them for many types of health
research, including studies to understand diseases or to compare patient
outcomes following different treatments. Once created, these collections
offer a cost-effective resource for rapidly addressing new research questions as technologies and knowledge advance. Collecting the samples and
data necessary to address each new research question as it arises could take
years, or even decades, at great expense. Thus, the pace and efficiency of
medical progress is significantly enhanced by using established resources
whenever feasible. Under the Common Rule, it is permissible to obtain
patient consent for future research, with IRB oversight, as long as such
future uses are described in sufficient detail to allow an informed consent.
However, the provisions of the Privacy Rule, as interpreted by HHS,
have made it more difficult to effectively use these valuable resources for
research. As a result, patients must be recontacted to obtain individual
authorization for any additional studies undertaken with the data and
samples collected unless the researchers obtain a waiver or alteration of
authorization from an IRB or a Privacy Board. Recontacting patients for
additional authorization is not only impractical, but even in those instances
when it is possible, it can be intrusive and burdensome for patients and their
families. The committee believes that authorization for future use of these
databases and biospecimen banks should be appropriate for protecting privacy as long as there is an IRB or a Privacy Board overseeing the research.
Thus, HHS should eliminate the discordance between the Privacy Rule and
the Common Rule through guidance explicitly stating that future research
may go forward if the authorization describes the types or categories of
research that may be conducted with the PHI stored in the bio­specimen
bank and if an IRB or a Privacy Board determines that the proposed new
research is not incompatible with the initial consent and authorization, and
poses no greater than minimal risk.
Because science is evolving very quickly, one cannot adequately anticipate what knowledge will be gained in the future, and significant opportunities for beneficial research could be lost without some alterations to the

way in which this portion of the Privacy Rule is interpreted. Databanks and
biospecimen banks created and maintained with federal funds in particular
should be used for multiple studies as often as feasible, given the high cost
of such activities and the high value of investigating and comparing multiple scientific questions from the same pool of data.
Additional guidance from HHS is also needed to clarify the circumstances under which DNA samples or sequences are considered PHI. The
research community remains uncertain about whether genetic information
accompanying biospecimens is protected under HIPAA because the list of
HIPAA identifiers includes “biometric identifiers” and “unique identifying
characteristics.”82 Although genetic information does not itself identify an
individual, a ­person’s genetic code could be construed as a unique identifier
in that it could be used to match sequence in another biospecimen bank
or databank that does include identifiers. As genetic information becomes
more prevalent in research and health care, concerns regarding genetic
privacy and discrimination are likely to intensify. Thus, the establishment
of consistent standards for use and protection of genetic information is
important. The committee advocates a focus on strong security measures,
with the goal of realizing the full potential of personalized medicine. In
addition, unauthorized reidentification of individuals from DNA sequences,
by anyone, should be strictly prohibited.
The committee also recommends that HHS issue guidance to clearly
indicate that when researchers seek to store data and materials collected in
conjunction with a clinical trial, a single authorization form with two signature lines is permissible if the text clearly delineates the two activities and
states that the participant is not required to sign the portion authorizing the
contribution of PHI to the repository. Informed consent and authorization
are essential for the protection of individuals who volunteer to participate
in clinical trials. Thus, it is imperative that the informed consent and
authorization documents are easily understood and meaningful to the individuals involved. Ideally, all relevant information should be integrated into
one simple document, but the HIPAA Privacy Rule’s complex provisions
have generated misperceptions about restrictions on individuals’ ability to
provide compound authorization for the related activities of clinical trial
participation and biospecimen donation, and some institutions require two
complete authorization forms with all the attendant language rather than
two signature lines on the same form. Such misperceptions can diminish
the informed nature of consent and authorization because they can lead to
patient confusion and misunderstanding.
HHS should also simplify the procedures for the identification and
recruitment of potential research participants and harmonize them with the

Common Rule. The provisions regarding these activities that are preparatory to research are complex, confusing, and actually provide less privacy
protection than the Common Rule. The committee believes that IRBs and
Privacy Boards can protect research participants, including their privacy
and confidentiality interests, and thus recommends that IRB/Privacy Board
approval (as required under the Common Rule) should be required for all
researchers (internal and external to the covered entity) prior to contacting potential subjects. When making a decision about whether to approve
research projects, the IRB or Privacy Board should review and consider
the investigator’s plans for contacting patients, and also ensure that the
information will be used only for research projects approved by the IRB or
Privacy Board and not be disclosed to anyone else.
HHS should also take steps to facilitate greater use of data with direct
identifiers removed. Because the Privacy Rule and the Common Rule define
personally identifiable information and deidentification differently, there is
a discrepancy between what research is exempt from the Common Rule and
what research is exempt from the Privacy Rule. This discrepancy can give
rise to situations in which research with anonymized data that are exempt
from IRB oversight under the Common Rule may still require a decision by
an IRB or a Privacy Board to determine if a waiver of individuals’ authorization for the use of their information for research purposes is appropriate
under the Privacy Rule.
Also, there appears to be a great deal of confusion about how to meet
conditions of data use agreements for limited datasets, which have been
stripped of the 16 most direct identifiers and can be used and disclosed for
research without obtaining individuals’ authorization or an IRB/Privacy
Board waiver of authorization. HHS could help to ameliorate this situation by issuing clear guidance on how to set up and comply with data use
agreements more efficiently and effectively.
New tools are also needed to facilitate important health research by
allowing new hypotheses to be tested with existing data. One major challenge of using data from which direct identifiers have been removed is that
a patient’s health information is rarely stored in one single location, and
data from multiple sources cannot be linked to generate a more complete
record of a patient’s health history without a unique identifier. As a result,
these datasets often are of minimal value to researchers and are not frequently used. A trusted intermediary that could link data from different
sources and then provide more complete and useful deidentified datasets to
researchers would facilitate the greater use of health data for research and
lead to more meaningful study results while also increasing patient privacy
protections and allaying concerns of covered entities. Thus, HHS should
develop a mechanism for linking data from multiple sources so that more
useful datasets can be made available for research in a manner that protects

privacy, confidentiality, and security. Similar efforts have been initiated by
AHRQ for the purpose of monitoring health care quality.
The committee also concluded that for some provisions of the Privacy
Rule the burdens are heavy and the privacy protections are small. Reconsideration of such provisions may be necessary if society is to derive maximal benefits from health research. In particular, the required accounting
of disclosures entails a heavy administrative burden on health systems and
health services research that achieves little in terms of protecting privacy.
The committee recommends that the Privacy Rule permit medical facilities
to inform patients in advance that PHI might be used for health research
(with IRB/Privacy Board oversight) or for public health purposes, and
the Privacy Rule should be altered to exempt these activities from AOD
requirements.
Robust safeguards are already in place to protect the privacy of PHI
disclosures in health research via IRBs and Privacy Boards. As the health
care system moves toward broader implementation of electronic health
records, however, automatic tracking of audit trails will be important to
incorporate. Technology advances will likely make automatic AOD tracking feasible, affordable, and widely available in the future. Until then, the
committee recommends that disclosures of PHI made for health research
and public health purposes be exempted from the HIPAA Privacy Rule’s
AOD requirement. However, in the interest of transparency, institutions
should maintain a list, accessible to the public, of all studies approved by
its IRB or Privacy Board.
HHS should also simplify the criteria that IRBs and Privacy Boards
use in making determinations for when they can waive the requirements
to obtain authorization from each patient whose PHI will be used for a
research study. If the current criteria for waiver of authorization are to be
retained, a clear and reasonable definition of impracticability from HHS,
along with specific case examples of what should or should not be considered impracticable or of minimal risk, could reduce variability and overly
conservative interpretations among IRBs and Privacy Boards.
Case examples should help delineate what IRBs and Privacy Boards
should do to facilitate research, rather than just defining what is permissible. For example, it is appropriate to allow use of registries, clinical databases, and biospecimen banks for justifiable scientific inquiries. HHS should
clearly state that IRBs and Privacy Boards should not impede research that
is permissible under the Privacy Rule without a compelling concern (for
example, if participant solicitation plans are inappropriate or if the principal investigator is unqualified).
Simplification or clarification of the waiver criteria would be especially
helpful for multi-institutional studies, which fall under the jurisdiction of
multiple IRBs or Privacy Boards, and for smaller or community-based insti-

tutions that do not have internal counsel or regulatory affairs specialists,
and are thus more likely to opt out of research that requires decisions about
authorizations. With better guidance, all covered entities would have more
confidence in their decisions, and might be more willing to rely on a lead
IRB/Privacy Board decision in the case of multi-institutional studies.

Since the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
Privacy Rule was implemented by the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services (HHS) in April 2003, health researchers have asserted
that the Privacy Rule has had a negative effect on researchers’ abilities to
conduct meaningful research. The purpose of this chapter is to review the
currently available evidence on the effect of the Privacy Rule on research,
including surveys as well as other types of studies to measure impact. The
chapter begins with an overview of several surveys that examined health
researchers’ personal experiences with and opinions about the Privacy
Rule. Many issues identified by survey respondents were also the focus of
other types of studies, so the remainder of the chapter consists of a topical
review of the available evidence regarding the effect of the Privacy Rule,
and its interpretation, on health research. The following issues are reviewed
in detail: (1) selection bias, (2) research efficiency, (3) abandoned research,
(4) deidentified information, (5) the authorization process, and (6) concerns
about potential legal consequences.
Overview of Survey Results
As noted in previous chapters (Chapter 1 in particular), the information gained by opinion surveys has limitations. The potential for bias exists
because of the way the questions are worded and framed, and respondents
may have self-motivated reasons for responding in a particular fashion. For
example, individuals responding to surveys conducted by professional societies may be more likely to have encountered difficulties with the Privacy

Rule than those who did not respond. Thus, information gathered from
surveys is anecdotal and based on individual’s personal opinions; it does
not constitute systematic data on the experience of all researchers.
Before discussing the relevant surveys in detail in this chapter, it is also
important to recognize the strengths and weaknesses of these survey data.
One strength is that multiple surveys addressed similar topics, and many
respondents were affiliated with different institutions and different fields
of health research. The fact that the respondents to the different surveys
reported similar problems with conducting research under the Privacy Rule
makes it more likely that results can be generalized and are not specific to
a particular institution. Weaknesses include the size and low response rates
of some surveys and, in some cases, the lack of a denominator, making it
impossible to determine a response rate, which is an important measure
to assess the representativeness of the results. Also, three of the surveys
discussed below were conducted immediately or shortly after the Privacy
Rule was implemented, before covered entities and other stakeholders
had adequate time to adapt to the new regulation. However, more recent
surveys of researchers’ experiences with the Privacy Rule, two of which
were commissioned by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) committee, found
that researchers were still reporting negative effects of the Privacy Rule on
health research (Box 5-1).
Surveys to gauge the impact of the HIPAA Privacy Rule on health
research have been undertaken by numerous agencies and organizations
with various constituencies, including the Association of American Medical
Colleges (NCVHS, 2003), the National Cancer Advisory Board (Ramirez
and Niederhuber, 2003), the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
(Walker, 2005), Epidemiological Societies (Ness, 2007), the HMO Research
Network (Greene et al., 2008), AcademyHealth (Helms, 2008), the American Heart Association (Ring, 2007), and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (Deapen, 2006). In addition, structured
interviews were undertaken by the American Society for Clinical Oncology
(ASCO, 2008), and focus groups were organized by the Association of
Academic Health Centers (AAHC, 2008). An overview of these projects is
provided below (also see Table 5-1).
Association of American Medical Colleges Survey
In 2003, on the day that covered entities were required to be in compliance with the Privacy Rule, the Association of American Medical Colleges
(AAMC) launched a survey to examine the Privacy Rule experiences of
investigators, Institutional Review Board (IRB) personnel, privacy officials,
research administrators, and deans. AAMC then created a database of case
reports and research functions affected by the Privacy Rule based on 331
individuals’ responses. After analyzing the database, AAMC concluded that

The Privacy Rule has increased the cost and time it takes to conduct a
research project from start to finish (AAMC, NCAB, AHRQ, Ness, AcademyHealth, HMORN, AHA/ACC, AAHC)
Institutional differences in interpretation of the Privacy Rule have made conducting health research more difficult than in the pre-Privacy Rule era (AAMC,
NCAB, AHRQ, Ness, AcademyHealth, HMORN, AAHC)
The Privacy Rule has made recruitment of research participants more difficult and has increased the likelihood of selection bias (AAMC, AHRQ, Ness,
AcademyHealth, AHA/ACC, AAHC)
The Privacy Rule has increased research participants’ confusion regarding
their rights and protections (NCAB, Ness, HMORN)
The Privacy Rule’s standards for deidentification have not created an effective
way for researchers to collect data (AAMC, AHRQ, Ness, AcademyHealth,
HMORN, AHA/ACC)
The Privacy Rule has led researchers to abandon studies (AAMC, AHRQ,
AcademyHealth, HMORN, ASCO)
The Privacy Rule has created new barriers to the use of patient specimens
collected during clinical trials (NCAB, AAHC, ASCO)

the Privacy Rule affects many types of health research, including clinical,
health services, epidemiological, behavioral, biomedical, health economics,
and outcomes research. The most common effects of the Privacy Rule on
research reported were that the Privacy Rule: (1) reduced patient recruitment, (2) increased the likelihood of selection bias, (3) increased the costs
of conducting research by requiring more paperwork and complicating the
IRB approval process, (4) increased the number of errors in research when
deidentified information was used, (5) made multisite trials more difficult
because of variations in IRB interpretation of the Rule, and (6) caused
researchers to abandon projects because of the increased number of rules
for operating a research study (NCVHS, 2003).

participate in the survey, or the response rate.

National Cancer Advisory Board Survey
The National Cancer Advisory Board (NCAB) conducted a survey
of health researchers’ experiences with the Privacy Rule in 2003. NCAB
requested the names of Privacy Rule experts from cancer center directors,
clinical cooperative group chairs, and principal investigators of Special Programs of Research Excellence. A total of 226 experts were identified. These
experts were invited to visit a website and submit public comments on the
effect of the Privacy Rule on cancer research. NCAB received 89 responses
to the survey, for a 39 percent response rate. The survey showed that the
majority of respondents believed that: (1) the Privacy Rule increased patient
confusion, (2) the Privacy Rule’s complex documentation requirements
delayed research, (3) differing interpretations of the Privacy Rule made
conducting health research more challenging, and (4) the Privacy Rule created new barriers to the use of patient specimens collected during clinical
trials (Ramirez and Niederhuber, 2003).
AHRQ Survey
In 2004, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)
interviewed 33 senior health care researchers, privacy officers, research
compliance officers, and IRB directors representing a variety of health
settings in 18 states that covered all regions of the United States. With a
77 percent response rate, 92 percent of respondents reported an impact of
the Privacy Rule on health research. Those reporting substantial impact
were often involved in multisite studies where follow-up information from
many patients was needed from many sources. Many respondents reported

conflicting IRB decisions, difficulties with authorization as well as access to
deidentified data, increased cost and time, and lack of participation from
small hospitals and provider groups due to lack of resources. More than
half of respondents thought that misinterpretations and overly conservative interpretations of the Privacy Rule were the cause of the difficulties
(Walker, 2005).
National Survey of Epidemiologists
The IOM committee commissioned a survey by Roberta Ness at the
University of Pittsburgh. In 2007, Dr. Ness conducted a web-based survey
of 1,527 epidemiologists who had submitted a new application to an IRB
for a research project involving human subjects research since the Privacy
Rule was implemented (see Appendix B for methodological details). The
survey asked respondents to answer a number of questions on a 5-point
Likert scale (1 = none, 5 = a great deal). More than 84 percent of respondents ranked the statement “the Privacy Rule made research easier” as a
1 or 2. In contrast, 68 percent of respondents ranked the statement “the
degree to which the Rule made research more difficult” as a 4 or 5. Only
11 percent of respondents stated that the Privacy Rule strengthened public
trust in research, and 26 percent responded that the Privacy Rule did a great
deal to enhance participant confidentiality and privacy (Figure 5-1).
This survey also provided respondents with the opportunity to write
in comments regarding their experiences conducting research under the
Privacy Rule. A total of 427 comments were received; 90 percent were
negative, 5 percent were neutral, and 5 percent were positive. The common
themes in the comments were: (1) the Privacy Rule added patient burden
without enhancing privacy protections, (2) institutions vary greatly in their
interpretations of the Privacy Rule, and (3) many government agencies are
confused about the demarcation between public health surveillance, which
is exempt from the Privacy Rule, and health research. Finally, the survey
found that many respondents believed the Privacy Rule added to research
costs, caused delays to research projects, and made recruitment of research
participants much more difficult (Ness, 2007).
HMO Research Network Survey
The IOM committee also commissioned data-gathering efforts from
the HMO Research Network (HMORN) of investigator and IRB members’
experiences operating under the Privacy Rule (see Appendix B for methodological details). The HMORN is a consortium of more than 250 scientists
who work in 15 research centers based in health care delivery systems. The
data collection efforts consisted of a web-based survey of investigators in

the Cancer Research Network (conducted in fall 2007), a follow-up telephone survey of those investigators who reported having a study affected
by the Privacy Rule, and a mailed survey to IRB administrators at the 15
HMORN sites (conducted in early 2008). The response rate for the investigator survey was 43 percent (235 investigators were invited to participate
in the survey, and 89 responses were received). Respondents were mostly
doctoral-level scientists, and 72 percent of them had been in research for
10 or more years. Twelve respondents completed telephone interviews. The
response rate for the IRB administrator survey was 73 percent (11 of the
15 sites submitted responses).
The results of these surveys are consistent with those of previous surveys. Respondents reported numerous difficulties with conducting health
research since the implementation of the Privacy Rule, including increased
time required to conduct research, problems with gaining IRB approval for
studies, impediments to multicenter research, confusion over the authorization process, and problems with the use of deidentified data. Of the
investigators who responded, 74 percent reported having a study affected
by the Privacy Rule. Of these respondents, 61 percent reported having a
study affected more than once. In addition, 60 percent of the investigators
reported difficulty conducting research under the requirements of the Privacy Rule. On the other hand, 59 percent of the investigators reported that
the Privacy Rule has strengthened patient privacy.
The IRB administrators were more positive than the investigators

regarding the Privacy Rule. Ninety percent of IRB administrators reported
that the Privacy Rule strengthened patient privacy. In addition, 46 percent
of IRB administrators said it was easy to work within the privacy regulations, as opposed to 36 percent of IRB administrators who said it was not
easy to work within the regulations. Nonetheless, 63 percent of IRB administrators reported that the Privacy Rule has made conducting research more
difficult. More than 72 percent of IRB administrators reported that the
federal government needs to give more guidance to IRBs about interpreting
and implementing the Privacy Rule (Greene et al., 2008).
AcademyHealth Survey
To provide input to the IOM study, AcademyHealth conducted a survey in 2007 of researchers’ experiences operating under the Privacy Rule.
AcademyHealth is a professional society for health services researchers
and health policy analysts. Its mission is to strengthen the research infrastructure, promote the use of the best available research, and assist health
policy and practice leaders in addressing major health care challenges. The
organization conducted a web-based survey of principal investigators. All
3,461 AcademyHealth members were invited to participate in the survey
by e-mail. A total 696 members responded. Out of this group, 396 members were principal investigators and met the criteria for inclusion in the
survey analysis. In general, 75 percent of the survey respondents reported
that their experiences with the Privacy Rule were negative. Only 6 percent of respondents reported that their experiences were positive. Nearly
half—48 percent—reported that their institution provided support to assist
researchers with HIPAA compliance and IRB issues, and 77 percent of the
researchers at these institutions indicated that they used these resources.
Respondents were also asked whether they believe the Privacy Rule strikes
the correct balance between protecting individual privacy and allowing
research to be conducted. A majority—63 percent—of the respondents
reported that the Privacy Rule provides protection to individuals at the
expense of access to research data; 28 percent reported that the Privacy
Rule strikes the right balance between these two goods; and only 1 percent reported that the Privacy Rule provides access to research data at the
expense of privacy protection for individuals (Figure 5-2) (Helms, 2008).
American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Survey
The American Heart Association (AHA) and the American College of
Cardiology (ACC) also conducted a survey in 2007. The 18,261 professional members of AHA and ACC were invited to complete a questionnaire by e-mail, and 656 individuals completed the survey. However, it

is important to note that many professional members of AHA and ACC
are practicing physicians, not researchers, and thus were not the intended
audience for the survey. Of the individuals completing the survey, 61 percent reported that they had submitted an IRB application since the Privacy
Rule was implemented. In general, the respondents indicated that the Privacy Rule had a negative impact on research and did not improve patient
privacy. Only 22 percent of respondents reported that the Privacy Rule
increased public trust in research, 44 percent reported that it increased
confidentiality, 9 percent reported that it decreased privacy breaches, and
14 percent reported that patients’ privacy was better protected than before
the Privacy Rule. Respondents also indicated that the Privacy Rule had a
negative impact on research recruitment, the IRB approval process, the cost
and time to conduct research, multicenter research, and the use of deidentified information (Ring, 2007).
North American Association of Central Cancer Registries
In 2006, the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries
(NAACCR) conducted a survey of its memberships’ experience operating

BEYOND THE HIPAA PRIVACY RULE

under the Privacy Rule. NAACCR members represent population-based
state, regional, and provincial cancer registries in Canada, the United States
and its territories. These registries provide cancer incidence data for public
health surveillance and research purposes. All 71 members of NAACCR
were invited to participate in the survey and 55 responses were received,
however, many of the members are not HIPAA covered entities. In general,
the respondents indicated that the Privacy Rule has interfered with both
basic cancer surveillance and registry-based research (Deapen, 2006).
American Society of Clinical Oncology Interviews
The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) gathered qualitative information through structured interviews in early 2008 with 27
compliance officials and investigators from 13 institutions about their
attitudes toward the Privacy Rule. Participants were presented with three
research scenarios prior to their interviews: (1) communication with cancer
survivors’ family members to request their participation in genetic studies
intended to investigate familial cancer syndromes, (2) establishment and use
of tissue and data banks that would contain protected health information
(PHI), and (3) identification and consent of cancer survivors to participate
in long-term survivorship studies. These scenarios were then discussed during the interviews to explore how the Privacy Rule standards are applied at
the different institutions, and to gauge the opinions of the researchers and
compliance officers toward the regulation.
Unlike some of the surveys, many of the ASCO interview participants
indicated that the Privacy Rule had a positive effect on privacy by triggering a reconsideration of how confidential health information is handled in
research. However, they also noted that different institutions’ IRBs have
very different approaches to complying with the Privacy Rule, and this can
impede important research. They identified the authorization process as the
most significant challenge to complying with the Privacy Rule, especially
for future research projects relying on stored tissue and databases. Compliance ­ officers and researchers disagreed on the possibility of obtaining
authorization for “future research.” Other problems identified included
abandoned studies, a lack of training and useful guidance documents on
the requirements of the Privacy Rule, and concerns about the security of
research databases (ASCO, 2008).
Association of Academic Health Centers Focus Groups
The Association of Academic Health Centers (AAHC) organized focus
groups in fall 2007 at five institutions to examine researchers’ experiences
operating under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Each focus group included both

209

researchers and compliance personnel from the institution, and all groups
were asked the same set of questions. The focus groups reported problems
with the Privacy Rule’s regulation of research similar to those found in
the surveys. Major issues identified included overly conservative interpretation of the Privacy Rule by institutions, diminished ability to recruit
research participants, obstacles in accessing stored tissue and genetic datasets, increased cost and time to conduct research, and increased complexity
in the IRB review procedures. Participants also indicated that some hospitals and community physicians were opting out of research, rather than
attempting to comply with the Privacy Rule (AAHC, 2008)
SELECTION BIAS
Selection bias is created when data are more likely to be collected from
one subset of the population than from a representative sample of the entire
population (see Box 3-8). This can cause a systematic difference between
the characteristics of the individuals included in a study and the individuals
not included. Selection bias is problematic for research because it can lead
to inaccurate results and it reduces the generalizability of research results to
the general population, as indicated by the examples described below.
The Privacy Rule has the potential to contribute to selection bias
because it requires researchers to seek patient authorization to access their
health records in most situations (see Chapter 4). Selection bias occurs if the
individuals who give permission for researchers to access their medical data
differ from the group of individuals who are unwilling to give permission
for their health information to be used in research. This section provides
a detailed overview of the evidence regarding the Privacy Rule’s impact on
selection bias. It starts with a description of relevant survey data from the
researcher surveys described above, then provides a summary of several
systematic studies that examined the effect of consent and authorization on
selection bias. It concludes with a section summarizing several studies that
specifically examined the Privacy Rule’s effect on research samples.
Two surveys provide evidence that researchers are concerned about the
Privacy Rule introducing selection bias into research. In the AHRQ survey,
74 percent of respondents reported that they had experienced problems
with sample representation and bias. One of the most commonly cited reasons for selection bias was that fewer patients have agreed to participate in
research since the Privacy Rule was implemented. Respondents indicated
that the complicated and lengthy authorization forms required by the Privacy Rule create an impediment to subject recruitment. Also, 42 percent of
respondents reported that many small health care entities and other entities
serving disadvantaged populations are not participating in research because
of an inability to meet all of the Privacy Rule requirements. This results in

BEYOND THE HIPAA PRIVACY RULE

the underrepresentation of minority populations in many research studies
(Walker, 2005).
A survey of NAACCR found similar results, with 36 percent of respondents reporting that the Privacy Rule had introduced selection bias into a
research project. The response rate for this survey was 66 percent (Deapen,
2006). A new privacy policy of Veterans Affairs has deepened concern
about bias in cancer registries (Kolata, 2007; see also Chapter 6). This
policy goes beyond the requirements of the Privacy Rule by requiring each
state to sign a national directive setting privacy standards for the use of
patients’ health information. Some states have refused to sign the directive, asserting that it is not feasible to meet the requirements. As a result,
cancer registries will not be representative of the entire U.S. population,
and researchers and public health officials will have difficulty interpreting
annual cancer statistics published by the National Cancer Institute.
General Studies of Consent and Selection Bias
Numerous studies have directly examined the effect of consent and authorization requirements on selection bias in a systematic manner (Al-Shahi et
al., 2005; Harris and Levy, 2008; McCarthy et al., 1999; Trevena et al., 2006;
Tu et al., 2004; Ward et al., 2007; Woolf et al., 2000). Woolf and colleagues
(2000) at Virginia Commonwealth University studied the effect of requiring
patients to give consent on the demographics of research participants at an
urban family practice center. Patients were recruited to complete the Health
Assessment Survey (HAS). At the end of the HAS, patients were asked to give
the researchers permission to contact them by phone or mail, and to review
their medical records. Of patients who completed the HAS survey, 67 percent
granted researchers consent to complete the follow-up activities, 25 percent
actively denied consent, and 8 percent did not answer the question. Patients
who gave consent were older, and included fewer women and African Americans than patients who did not give consent. Patients who actively denied
consent were younger, included more women, and were more educated than
patients giving consent. Also, patients who gave consent differed in health
status from patients who denied consent. The researchers concluded that
patients willing to release personal health information for health services
research differed on important characteristics from patients denying consent
(Woolf et al., 2000).
A study conducted by Jack Tu and colleagues (2004) examined the
effect of requiring consent on the representativeness of the Registry of the
Canadian Stroke Network of the entire population of individuals with
stroke. The researchers found that requiring consent before enrollment
created a database that was not representative. Patients who agreed to
participate in the stroke database were younger, more likely to be alert at

211

admission to the hospital, more likely to be alive at discharge, and were
more likely to speak English or French than those patients who did not
agree to participate in the database.
In addition, the in-hospital discharge rates differed significantly between
enrolled patients (7 percent) and unenrolled patients (22 percent). This difference was likely due to the difficulty in approaching critically ill patients
and their family members for recruitment during the ordeal of a stroke.
Also, many stroke patients were unable to give or decline to give consent
because they were cognitively impaired. The selection bias occurred at
hospitals with both high and low participation rates. Based on this study’s
results, the Registry of the Canadian Stroke Network switched from a
­consent-based system to a system that uses deidentified patient data and
does not require patient consent, to ensure the universality of the registry
(Tu et al., 2004). This change, however, eliminated the possibility of followup interviews with patients.
In Scotland, a study conducted by Rustam Al-Shahi and colleagues
(2005) evaluated the effect of requiring consent on prospective, observational research. The researchers attempted to obtain informed consent to
review the medical records and conduct annual follow-up questionnaires
of all patients residing in Scotland who presented with intracranial vascular malformation between 1999 and 2002. An ethics board gave the
­researchers permission to collect baseline and follow-up data on those
patients who did not give consent. The researchers found that adults who
consented to participate in the study differed on important prognostic variables from patients who did not consent. For example, patients who gave
consent were significantly less likely to have intracranial hemorrhage, or to
be dependent at presentation. During the yearly follow-ups, patients who
gave consent were significantly more likely to have received interventional
treatment, less likely to have died, and more likely to have had an epileptic
seizure than nonconsenters. The researchers concluded that requiring consent for observational research produced significant selection bias (Al-Shahi
et al., 2005).
McCarthy and colleagues (1999) studied a Minnesota law that required
patient-informed consent before medical records were permitted to be used
by researchers. In this pharmacoepidemiologic study, 73 of 140 potential
research participants responded to a request for informed consent, with
26 of the potential research participants authorizing the use of their medical records for the study, and 47 declining. Although it is unclear whether
there were important differences between the group of individuals granting

generalizability of the study results. In contrast, the researchers achieved a
93 percent recruitment rate for this study in states without a privacy law

requiring informed consent, where health care providers could grant access
to patient medical records based on a general enrollment authorization.
The low participation rate in Minnesota was directly attributed to the state
privacy law (McCarthy et al., 1999).
Similar results were found in the study that examined the effect of the
recent Australian privacy legislation on selection bias in health research.
Trevena and colleagues (2006) conducted a randomized trial comparing
recruitment under an opt-out and an opt-in methodology. In the opt-out
condition, potential research participants were informed that their physician was participating in a research study, and if they did not wish to be
contacted by the researchers they should inform their physician and their
contact information would be withheld. Under the opt-in condition, potential research participants could only be contacted by researchers if they
affirmatively gave permission in writing, over the phone, or via e-mail to the
researchers. This study found that a smaller percentage of potential research
participants participated under the opt-in methodology (47 percent) compared to the opt-out methodology (67 percent). Although there was no
difference in the age, sex, health status, or socioeconomic status between
the opt-in and opt-out populations, individuals in the opt-in group were
more likely (75 percent) to prefer an active role in making health care decisions than individuals in the opt-out group (45 percent). The ­ researchers
concluded that the opt-in method produced a sample of research participants who differed in important behavioral characteristics from the opt-out
method participants (Trevena et al., 2006).
In a study of the United Kingdom Data Protection Act of 1998, epidemiological researchers assessed their ability to recruit potential research
participants under this Act. The researchers wrote to a number of physicians and recruited them to participate in the study. If the physicians
agreed to participate, the researchers requested the physicians to randomly
select 20 of their patients and ask them to consent to being contacted by
the ­ researchers. Those individuals granting consent to be contacted were
then invited by the researchers to participate in the study. Following this
methodology, the researchers were only able to obtain consent from 16
percent of the patients approached. They concluded that such a low participation rate led to selection bias, as well as inadequate statistical power
and ­statistical significance. They documented that health care workers were
over­represented in the resulting study population (Ward et al., 2007).
HIPAA Authorization and Selection Bias
Several studies have explicitly examined whether the provisions of the
Privacy Rule contribute to biased research samples. Armstrong and colleagues (2005) at the University of Michigan conducted a 6-month follow-

up questionnaire for the Acute Coronary Syndrome Registry. They then
compared the percentage of patients who gave consent pre-HIPAA and
post-HIPAA for participation in the follow-up survey. In the pre-HIPAA
time period, informed consent for the follow-up questionnaire was given
over the phone by the patient. In the post-HIPAA era, written informed
consent and authorization were required. The percentage of patients consenting to complete the questionnaire decreased from 96 percent in the preHIPAA era to 34 percent in the post-HIPAA era. Patients who gave consent
post-HIPAA were more likely to be older, married, and white than those
who refused to provide consent or did not respond. Patients who gave consent also had lower mortality rates at 6 months than patients who refused
consent. The results suggest that implementation of the Privacy Rule led to
selection bias in the Registry (Armstrong et al., 2005).
Beebe and colleagues (2007) at the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine
in Rochester, MN, followed up on the Armstrong study and conducted a
randomized clinical trial that examined the effect of the Privacy Rule on
response rate and selection bias. In this study, 6,939 research participants
were randomly assigned to one of two research conditions: (1) one condition required patients to complete and return a HIPAA authorization form
in order to participate in the study, and (2) in the second condition, patients
were not required to complete a HIPAA authorization form to participate.
The response rates were significantly different between the condition requiring an authorization form (38 percent) and the condition not requiring an
authorization form (55 percent). However, unlike the studies described
above, the researchers did not find that the lower response rate translated
into a detectable selection bias (Beebe et al., 2007).
The lack of detectable selection bias in this study could be the result of
the authorization form used. Beebe and colleagues used a simple one-page
authorization form. In the other studies discussed in this section, the authorization forms were much longer than one page and were often written in
complex language. Simplifying the authorization form likely minimized the
effect of requiring patient authorization on potential research participants’
willingness to participate in a study. However, as will be discussed below
in the chapter section on the authorization process, a majority of covered
entities require lengthy and highly legalistic authorization forms.
Another study that examined the effect of the Privacy Rule on selection
bias was conducted by Dunlop and colleagues (2007) at Emory University
in Atlanta. In this study the researchers investigated the impact of including an authorization form on the willingness of African Americans to
participate in a clinical study of an antihypertensive medication. Research
­participants were randomly assigned to one of two study conditions in
which they received either (1) an informed consent form (informed consent
condition), or (2) an informed consent form and an authorization form

(authorization condition). The researchers recorded the reasons that potential research participants gave for declining to participate in the study.
The study found that a smaller percentage of research participants in
the authorization condition indicated a willingness to participate in the
study than in the informed consent condition (27 percent versus 39 percent). This was especially true for individuals over 40 years of age with a
high school education or less, and in men. In addition, individuals required
to complete an authorization form were more likely to report the following
reasons for declining to participate in the study: (1) concerns related to mistrust or fear of research, researchers, or research institutions, and (2) poor
comprehension of forms. The researchers concluded that the Privacy Rule’s
authorization requirement acted as a deterrent for African American participation in research (Dunlop et al., 2007).
EFFICIENCY OF RESEARCH
Substantial evidence indicates that many institution’s implementation
and interpretation of the Privacy Rule have had a detrimental effect on
health researchers’ ability to efficiently conduct information-based research.
This section reviews the available evidence on the effect of the Privacy Rule,
and its interpretation, on the efficiency of research in terms of (1) cost and
time, (2) research participant recruitment, (3) IRB oversight of research
projects, (4) international collaboration between researchers, and (5) the
use of business associate agreements.
Cost and Time
In the 2000 version of the Privacy Rule, HHS estimated that the Privacy Rule would cost the health care industry more than $17.6 billion to
implement. The expected costs for research were projected to be more
than $40 million the first year, and $585 million over 10 years. The 2002
version of the Privacy Rule reduced the projected costs for implementing
the research provisions by $10 million the first year, and $146 million over
10 years. HHS stated that it was difficult to conduct a true cost–benefit
analysis of the Privacy Rule because the value of protecting health privacy
is difficult to quantify. However, in implementing the Privacy Rule, the
agency clearly decided that the benefits of protecting privacy outweighed
the economic costs of the Privacy Rule. The aggregate cost to research has

not been measured or estimated since April 2003, and as outlined below,
researchers’ estimates of the increase in cost and time attributable to the
Privacy Rule vary widely.
In a recent article published in the Annual Review of Medicine, Nosowsky
and Giordano (2006) reviewed the existing evidence on the effect of the
Privacy Rule on research, and concluded that the costs projected by HHS
have more than been realized by covered entities, ­ researchers, and IRBs,
although no figures were cited. They attributed the increased research costs
to the large amounts of paperwork required by the Privacy Rule, increased
staff time, and difficulties in recruiting research participants. They concluded that these additional burdens on research have pushed ­researchers
to reformulate and abandon many studies. Furthermore, the authors speculated that these changes have increased the need for ­researchers to obtain
additional funding, discouraged investigator-initiated research, and caused
many smaller research projects to end (Nosowsky and Giordano, 2006).
Many researchers report that the implementation of the Privacy Rule
increased the cost of conducting health research and increased the time
­necessary to conduct a research project from start to finish. The national
survey of epidemiologists found that most respondents believe the Privacy
Rule increased the cost and time of conducting health research. In this survey, 90 percent of the respondents reported an increase in resource expenditure, with 40 percent indicating that the Privacy Rule increased research
costs a great deal (i.e., 4–5 on the Likert scale). Half of the respondents
indicated that the additional time required to comply with the Privacy
Rule was great (4–5 on the Likert scale) (Figure 5-3a) (Ness, 2007). In the
AHA/ACC survey, 78 percent of respondents reported that the Privacy Rule
increased the cost of research, and 79 percent reported that it increased the
time to conduct research (Ring, 2007).
The AcademyHealth survey results were similar, with 86 percent of
respondents reporting that the Privacy Rule increased the time necessary
for research, and 8 percent of those reporting that the increase was so great
that it led some researchers to forego projects. In terms of cost, 73 percent
of respondents reported that the Privacy Rule increased the cost of research
(4 percent much more, 24 percent significantly more, and 45 percent somewhat more) (Helms, 2008) (Figure 5-3b).
In the HMORN survey of investigators, 55 percent of respondents
reported that study time lines were negatively affected by the Privacy
Rule (Figure 5-4). A third of the investigators indicated that the Privacy Rule
delayed their research by 1 to more than 3 months. Also, investigators
reported that the Privacy Rule led to a median of 20 additional staff hours
required to comply with the requirements of the regulation. Twelve percent
of respondents reported that 100 or more staff hours were required. In one
extreme case in the structured interview portion of this survey, an inves-

taken pre-HIPAA. In addition,
66 percent of respondents indicated that the
Figure 5-4.eps
Privacy Rule had been cited as the reason for actions that interfered with
nonresearch operations of the cancer registry, such as basic surveillance
(Deapen, 2006).
A number of researchers have attempted to quantitatively document
the increased time and cost of research attributable to the implementation of the Privacy Rule at their institutions. It is important to note that
these ­studies are site specific and depend on how institutions interpret and
implement the Privacy Rule. A recent letter to the editor of ­Anesthesiology
reported on the amount of research staff hours spent per month on recruitment and follow-up activities in a randomized clinical trial at the University
of Pittsburgh, before and after the Privacy Rule went into effect. Implementation of the Privacy Rule led to a 75-hour increase per month in staff time
spent updating work logs, and a 77-hour increase in time spent on HIPAA
implementation tasks. According to the authors’ calculations, this was a
70 percent increase in staff hours above the monthly base workload. The
authors did not try to determine which aspects of the Privacy Rule were
responsible for the recorded increases (Williams et al., 2007).
Similarly, the Armstrong study on the Acute Coronary Syndrome
­Registry documented that the incremental cost for this registry at the University of ­Michigan of complying with the Privacy Rule was $8,704.50 for
the first year, and an additional $4,558.50 for each year thereafter. The
authors did not report the total expenditure of the study but suggested

BEYOND THE HIPAA PRIVACY RULE

that this was a substantial increase in the study’s budget (Armstrong et al.,
2005).
Johns Hopkins University estimates that the cost of complying with the
Privacy Rule is about $2 million annually (Friedman, 2006). Since the Privacy Rule was implemented, the institution calculated that it has required
nearly 26,000 of its faculty and staff to pass a written test on their understanding of the Privacy Rule.
Recruitment
A number of researchers have also demonstrated that many interpretations of the Privacy Rule have made research recruitment more difficult
(Table 5-2). During a clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of an educational
strategy to inform veterans about the National Cancer Institute/­Department
of Veterans Affairs Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial
(SELECT), Wolf and Bennett (2006) monitored the recruitment of research
participants before and after implementation of the Privacy Rule. Several
recruitment methods were used throughout this clinical trial, depending on
the phase of HIPAA implementation. Before the Privacy Rule was implemented, potential research participants were directly approached by research
assistants for informed consent. After the Privacy Rule was implemented,
research assistants could no longer approach potential research participants; recruitment was done by hospital staff. The post-HIPAA recruitment protocol was modified once to increase participation rates. Under the
modified protocol, potential research participants were introduced to the
study by desk staff at the medical clinic where the study was conducted, all
clinic staff members were reminded of the study, and a research assistant
was stationed prominently in the medical clinic.
The researchers were able to recruit seven patients a week in the preHIPAA phase. The average time to recruit a patient was 4.1 hours, for an
average cost of $49 per patient. The study was on target to complete recruitment in 60 weeks. Immediately after the Privacy Rule was implemented,
recruitment decreased by 73 percent to 1.9 patients per week. The average
time to recruit each new patient was 14.1 hours, for a cost of $169 per
patient. Meeting the recruitment goals of the study at this rate would require
158 weeks. The modified recruitment protocol increased recruitment to 7.1
patients a week, required 3.9 hours, and cost $52 per patient. The modified
recruitment strategy was measured again at a later date in the study to assess
whether the modified protocol could be maintained. During this time period,
5.2 patients were recruited per week. Research assistants needed an average
of 5.4 hours to recruit each patient, for a cost of $65 per patient.
The authors concluded that the Privacy Rule dramatically hindered
researchers’ ability to recruit research participants. Implementation of the

Privacy Rule increased the cost and time required for recruitment and made
it more difficult to achieve an appropriate-sized research sample. Although
the modified protocol increased recruitment, the fact that the initial recruitment level could not be maintained over time suggests that the new protocol
required a great deal of effort and did not completely solve recruitment
difficulties. In addition, an intensive evaluation of a study’s recruitment
process to devise a new strategy, as was required to develop the modified
protocol, costs money, takes time, and may not always be possible (Wolf
and Bennett, 2006).
A reduced rate of recruitment following implementation of the Privacy Rule was also documented by Roberta Ness in the course of a study
on pregnancy exposures and preeclampsia prevention at the University
of Pittsburgh. Again, the recruitment methods were divided into several
different time periods: (1) pre-HIPAA (1997–2001), (2) 2002, (3) April
2003–September 2003, (4) October 2003–May 2004, and (5) June 2004. In
the pre-HIPAA time period, researchers recruited an average of 12.4 women
a week. In 2002 recruitment was shut down completely for 4 months while
the covered entity where the study was being conducted decided how to
implement the requirements of the Privacy Rule.

220

BEYOND THE HIPAA PRIVACY RULE

From April 2003 to September 2003, recruitment was allowed to
continue, but the covered entity was unwilling to grant any waivers of
authorization. Researchers recruited only 2.5 women a week. In October
2003, the covered entity allowed waivers of authorization to be issued,
and the researchers were able to review potential research participants’
medical records without obtaining authorization. However, the waivers
of authorization required that the researchers obtain the consent of the
potential research participants’ health care providers before the researchers
could approach individuals for participation in the study. Approximately
5.7 women a week were recruited following this protocol. The need for
the health care providers’ permission prevented recruitment from reaching
pre-HIPAA levels. The covered entity merged with another covered entity
in June 2004, and the waiver of authorization was retracted. Recruitment
immediately fell to 3.3 women a week (Ness, 2005). These recruitment
numbers clearly demonstrate that the implementation and interpretation
of the Privacy Rule, and the availability of waivers of authorization, can
have an enormous influence on recruitment success. They also show that
conducting research under changing policies, organization, or interpretations of the Privacy Rule can be problematic.
Several studies that were discussed previously provide further evidence that many interpretations of the Privacy Rule have made research
recruitment more difficult. The Beebe study found that the percentage of
potential research participants willing to participate declined when HIPAA
authorization was required at the Mayo Clinic College of ­Medicine. More
than half—55 percent—of potential research participants participated in
the study when authorization was not required, but only 39.8 percent of
potential research participants took part if they were required to complete
an authorization form (Beebe et al., 2007). In the Dunlop study, 39 percent
of potential research participants indicated a willingness to participate in
a clinical trial of a hypertensive medication when authorization was not
required. Only 27 percent indicated a willingness to participate when
­authorization was required (Dunlop et al., 2007).
Also, the national survey of epidemiologists found Privacy Rule modifications were needed in 84.8 percent of proposed research protocols. Of
these cases, 68 percent of respondents reported that these modifications
increased recruitment difficulties a great deal (4–5 on the Likert scale) (Ness,
2007). In the ­AcademyHealth survey, 47 percent of respondents reported
that the Privacy Rule decreased recruitment (Helms, 2008). Similarly, the 49
percent of respondents to the AHA/ACC survey reported that the Privacy
Rule decreased recruitment by more than 10 percent (Ring, 2007).

IRB and Privacy Board Oversight
A previous IOM report noted that the workload of IRBs, and the complexity of their work, has been steadily increasing as a result of new and
evolving requirements for research regulation and documentation (IOM,
2002), including the HIPAA Privacy Rule. This heavy burden has increased
the difficulty of both recruiting knowledgeable IRB members and allowing
them sufficient time for the necessary ethical reflection to make appropriate
decisions about human research projects. In addition, the report noted that
the extreme variability in the approval decisions and regulatory interpretations among IRBs is one of the weaknesses in the current protection system
(IOM, 2002). Recent findings from surveys and other studies indicate that
these issues are a continuing concern for both IRBs and Privacy Boards.
This section provides a detailed review of the evidence that the Privacy
Rule, and its interpretation, has had a detrimental effect on the oversight
process for reviewing research proposals, including information on: (1) IRB
approval, (2) exemption from full IRB review, (3) waiver of authorization,
(4) differentiating types of research, and (5) inconsistent interpretation
of the Privacy Rule by IRBs and Privacy Boards in multicenter research
projects.
IRB Approval
Recent surveys provide evidence that the Privacy Rule, or its interpretation, has reduced the efficiency of health research by affecting researchers’
ability to move a study through the IRB approval process. In the AHRQ
survey, 94 percent of respondents stated that the Privacy Rule impacted
the design and conduct of health services research. The respondents who
reported that the Privacy Rule had no impact on study design were all
researchers who used only deidentified data and were not required to go
through the IRB/Privacy Board review process under the Privacy Rule
(Walker, 2005). Similarly, in the national survey of epidemiologists, 87 percent of respondents reported an increase in the time required for preparing
a research proposal for review by an IRB (Ness, 2007).
The AcademyHealth survey found that 69 percent of respondents
reported difficulty gaining approval from IRBs to collect PHI. Respondents
also reported difficulty gaining approval to collect PHI from health plans
(32 percent), institution lawyers (29 percent), and physicians (25 percent).
In the HMORN survey of investigators, respondents reported that they
were required to submit a research project for a median of two additional
IRB iterations after the Privacy Rule was implemented. Twenty percent of
investigators reported that four or more IRB iterations were required. Also,
investigators reported that in one-third of study protocols, modifications

BEYOND THE HIPAA PRIVACY RULE

were due to an IRB requirement. In that survey, 29 percent of investigators reported that an IRB required them to modify their planned method
of identifying potential research participants, 29 percent reported that an
IRB put restrictions on the kind of identifiers that could be collected, and
59 percent reported that an IRB required a study to be modified to include
additional consent and/or authorization language (Greene et al., 2008). The
AHA/ACC survey also found that 67 percent of respondents reported that
the IRB submission process was made more complex by the Privacy Rule
(Ring, 2007).
Exemption from Full IRB Review
Certain types of research that pose minimal risk to human subjects are
exempt from IRB review under the Common Rule (45 C.F.R. § 46.101).
For these studies, an IRB chair or member can review an application for
exemption and determine if the study meets the criteria for exemption. If
the study qualifies for exemption, then no further IRB review is necessary.
Expedited IRB review is a process allowed by the Common Rule (45 C.F.R.
§ 46.110) in which an IRB chair or member reviews the entire study protocol. A study conducted by O’Herrin and colleagues (2004) examined the
effect of the Privacy Rule on applications for IRB exemption for proposed
research projects at the University of Wisconsin. This study was broken
down into three time periods: (1) September 1999–December 2000, during
which there was no specific process for handling requests for IRB exemption for medical records studies; (2) January 2001–December 2002, during
which the institution followed a standardized procedure for Applications
for Exemption; and (3) January 2003–March 2003, during which the IRB
became fully compliant with the Privacy Rule.
During Period 1, all the medical records research projects submitted
to the IRB were approved under “expedited” IRB review procedures. In
Period 2, 89 percent of the applications received an IRB exemption without revision. Of the applications that required revision, 36 percent were
revised and successfully approved for exemption within 75 ± 64 days of the
original submission. The remaining applications required review by the full
IRB committee, but were all ultimately given approval. In Period 3, when
the covered entity was in full compliance with the Privacy Rule, 59 percent
of proposals received exemption from full IRB review without revision in
12 ± 23 days. Of the projects requiring revision, 50 percent were revised
and approved within 29 ± 35 days of the initial submission.
The percentage of projects that required full IRB committee review
increased from 0 percent in Period 1, to 7 percent in Period 2, to 16 percent in Period 3. The authors of this study concluded that the Privacy Rule
complicated the IRB review process because a larger percentage of studies

223

became ineligible for IRB exemption or expedited IRB review. Also, the
complexity of the IRB approval process discouraged many researchers from
completing their proposed research study. Of the applications that required
full IRB committee review, 77 percent were abandoned by the researchers
in Period 3. Most of the abandoned studies were chart reviews, and there
was no evidence that the full IRB committee review was justified or a necessary change that safeguarded research participants’ privacy (O’Herrin et
al., 2004).
Waiver of Authorization
The Privacy Rule allows a covered entity to use and disclose PHI for
research purposes without patient authorization if an IRB or Privacy Board
determines that a research project meets three criteria, including minimal
risk to patient privacy, and whether the study could practicably be conducted without the waiver of authorization and without access to and use
of PHI (see Chapter 4). However, surveys indicate that many researchers
have experienced difficulty in obtaining a waiver of authorization. In the
national survey of epidemiologists, 40 percent of respondents reported that
they had attempted to obtain a waiver of authorization under the Privacy
Rule. Of these researchers, 31 percent reported a high level of difficulty in
obtaining a waiver (4–5 on the Likert scale) (Ness, 2007).
The AcademyHealth survey also examined this issue, with 62 percent
of respondents reporting that they had been involved in one or more
studies requiring waivers or alterations of authorization requirements by
IRBs (65 percent had been involved in 2–5 studies, and 3 percent had been
involved in more than 20 studies). Among respondents who had requested
waivers or alteration of waivers from IRBs or Privacy Boards, 59 percent
reported that the availability of existing datasets has been impacted by
the Privacy Rule. Only 40 percent of the respondents who had requested
­waivers or alterations of authorization reported that they were successful
in accessing data from an existing dataset in its original form under an
approved waiver of authorization (Helms, 2008). In the AHA/ACC survey, 59 percent of respondents reported attempting to obtain a waiver of
authorization. Of those respondents, 69 percent reported the waiver was
hard to attain (Ring, 2007).
Differentiating Various Types of Research
Scientific and ethical difficulties may arise when rules that were developed to guide clinical research are applied to other kinds of research
­(Casarett et al., 2005). Under the Privacy Rule, IRBs are charged with
reviewing different types of health research that were previously not in their

purview, including many types of health services research that use data that
have been anonymized and are thus exempt under the Common Rule, so
making judgments about approval and determining which research studies
require a waiver of authorization is a challenge. Some evidence indicates
that IRBs do not recognize important differences among various types of
health research. In the AcademyHealth survey, 44 percent of the respondents reported that IRBs did not correctly differentiate between clinical
research and health services research (and 25 percent were unsure). Clinical
research often involves the study of a new drug or experimental treatment
on human subjects. In contrast, respondents to the AcademyHealth survey
reported that most of health services research involves survey or questionnaire data (82 percent), medical record review (70 percent), and administrative data (66 percent). Only a small portion of respondents reported
doing health research studies that involved direct human contact; 9 percent
reported conducting research that required the collection of specimens, and
5 percent reported conducting research on existing specimens. Also, survey
respondents indicated that IRBs often did not differentiate between the cost
and time required to conduct health services research compared to clinical
research (Helms, 2008).
Inconsistent Interpretation of the Privacy Rule: Multicenter Research
Research studies that entail the collection of data from multiple sites
involve the jurisdiction of multiple IRBs or Privacy Boards. The Privacy
Rule does not require a researcher to obtain a waiver of authorization from
the IRB or Privacy Board of every entity that is contributing PHI. Covered
entities are permitted to rely on a waiver of authorization approved by as
few as one IRB or Privacy Board with jurisdiction. However, a covered
entity may decide to require approval from its own IRB or Privacy Board
prior to disclosing PHI to the requesting researcher, regardless of whether
another IRB or Privacy Board had already granted a waiver of authorization. The Privacy Rule does not address potential disagreements between
IRBs or Privacy Boards, but HHS “strongly encourages” researchers to
notify IRBs and Privacy Boards of any prior reviews of a research protocol
to reduce the chance of IRBs and Privacy Boards disagreeing.
Surveys indicate that the Privacy Rule has had a detrimental effect
on the efficiency of multicenter health research because the participating covered entities, IRBs, and Privacy Boards interpret the Privacy Rule
differently (AAHC, 2008; Ring, 2007). Researchers conducting a single
study at different locations are routinely required to go through multiple
IRB/Privacy Board review processes, and to use different authorization
forms and methodology across the various sites, even though the Privacy
Rule permits reliance on the review or decision of one IRB or Privacy
Board for all sites.

In the AHRQ survey, 65 percent of respondents reported problems
satisfying the requirements of multiple IRBs for multisite studies. One area
with which researchers reported significant frustration was the lack of
consistent consent and authorization forms (Walker, 2005). The AcademyHealth survey found that 28 percent of researchers who required a waiver
of authorization to conduct a study were required to get the waiver from
all research sites involved. Only 9 percent of the respondents reported that
the same waiver was used at all sites, and 6 percent reported the waivers
were required from more than one, but not all, sites. Three percent of
the respondents reported that they were unable to proceed with a multisite study because they were unable to resolve disagreement among sites
(Helms, 2008).
In the HMORN survey of investigators, 78 percent of respondents
reported participating in multicenter research. Of these respondents 54 percent indicated that different IRBs raised different concerns about the same
study protocol, and 45 percent of respondents reported that these different
concerns led to protocol variability across the different sites (Figure 5-5).
The HMORN survey of IRB administrators found that 4 of the 11 IRBs
reported requiring proof of Privacy Rule–related training for all participating investigators in a study, even if they were from another site. This
requirement is not a provision of the Privacy Rule (Greene et al., 2008).
The national survey of epidemiologists also confirms that many
researchers are frustrated with the process of conducting research at multiple covered entities. In the survey, 76.8 percent of respondents reported
difficulties with the Privacy Rule when conducting multicenter research.
The problems related to site-specific variability in the research design and
method in 40 percent of studies. The survey further explored this issue by
presenting survey participants with five case studies that should have been
approved without patient authorization either unconditionally or with a
waiver of authorization under the Privacy Rule. However, on each of the
case studies, 4.7 to 33.8 percent of respondents reported that their IRB
would disapprove the study. Only 4.9 to 33.8 percent believed that their
IRB would unconditionally approve the studies, and 13.3 to 26.7 percent
reported that they did not know what their IRB would require. To further
complicate multicenter research, a minority of respondents (17.3 percent)
knew of covered entities unwilling to do any clinical research, regardless of
the IRB’s interpretation of the Privacy Rule (Ness, 2007).
In addition to the survey results, several studies have directly examined the effect of the Privacy Rule, or its interpretation, on multicenter
research. Lydon-Rochelle and Holt (2004) at the University of Washington
documented their experience in attempting to access medical records from
19 area hospitals during the Privacy Rule implementation period, for a
study designed to assess the accuracy of maternally linked birth records.
They explained to the participating hospitals that their study protocol met

the Privacy Rule waiver of authorization requirement and encouraged the
hospitals’ IRBs to rely on their IRB’s approval of the study. However, the 19
IRBs displayed great variability in their willingness to approve the study.
None of the 19 hospitals agreed to rely on the researchers’ own institution’s IRB approval of the study. Ten hospitals used an expedited in-house
IRB review process for the study, and 9 required a full IRB review of the
study. The 9 IRBs requiring full review of the study cited concerns over the
Privacy Rule’s civil and criminal penalties as the main reason for denying
expedited review or for not honoring another IRB’s decisions. All 19 of the
reviewing IRBs required different application forms, content, and procedures for complying with the Privacy Rule. The authors concluded that the
Privacy Rule has increased the difficulty of conducting multicenter health
research because of the challenges of navigating through many IRBs’ review
processes (Lydon-Rochelle and Holt, 2004).
A second study that examined the institutional variability in IRB
approval processes was conducted by Newgard and colleagues (2005).
The researchers sent 27 hospitals an identical research protocol for a study
examining a decision rule to identify children seriously injured in motor

vehicle crashes in Los Angeles County. This was a minimal risk observational study and clearly met the requirements for a waiver of authorization.
However, 6 of the 27 hospitals refused to participate in the study at all. Of
the remaining 21 hospitals, the median time for the study to be approved by
the covered entities’ IRBs was 118 days. Significant differences in approval
times were seen across the different covered entities.
The researchers recognized they could not conclusively attribute the
hospitals’ refusals to participate in the study and the long IRB review processes to the Privacy Rule itself. However, they believed the Privacy Rule
was largely responsible for the results. They compared their experience to
a previous study conducted in Los Angeles County before the implementation of the Privacy Rule. The same 27 hospitals were approached for
participation in a randomized, controlled, interventional trial for emergent
airway management in children with a waiver of consent. All 27 hospitals
approved the airway protocol without change, while only 21 of the same
27 hospitals approved Newgard and colleagues’ minimal risk, noninterventional study. The authors believed this difference was directly attributable
to the complex requirements of the Privacy Rule and the perceived institutional risks associated with research (Newgard et al., 2005).
A third study that examined the impact of allowing multiple IRBs
to review the same research proposal was conducted by Greene and colleagues (2006). Participants were recruited through a mailed invitation
for a survey of psychosocial outcomes after prophylactic mastectomy. A
second mailing and a follow-up phone call were made to nonresponders.
The study’s protocol was reviewed by six IRBs. All of the IRBs requested
that the ­protocol, letters, and phone call script be modified. Resolving all
of the IRBs’ concerns took two to eight iterations at each site, and achieving a uniform study methodology across the sites was impossible. Also, the
response rates at the six institutions varied greatly, ranging from 40.9 to
70.8 percent among living individuals, to 60.7 to 84.6 percent among living
individuals with physician consent and correct address.
The authors concluded that having multiple IRBs review the same study
protocol lengthened the study time line, adversely affected the budget, and
created protocol variability that may have affected response rate (Greene et
al., 2006). This study did not specifically focus on the Privacy Rule. However, as demonstrated by the other studies discussed in this section, since
the Privacy Rule was implemented, IRBs are often unwilling to honor the
decisions of other IRBs. The Privacy Rule likely contributed to the six IRBs
in this study all insisting on reviewing the same research protocol and for
the resulting variability in study design.

Business Associate Agreements
The AcademyHealth survey indicated that most health services
r­ esearchers do not use business associate agreements to gain access to
health data, but when they do, difficulties often arise. Twenty-two percent of the respondents reported using a business associate agreement to
conduct research, and of these respondents, most reported that the business associate agreement negatively impacted research activities because
it complicated the research process, made research more time consuming,
and added more paperwork. Of the respondents who reported that they
have used an existing dataset to conduct research, 28 percent indicated
that they had to develop a business associate relationship with the covered
entity to gain access to the dataset. Another 14 percent reported use of an
intermediary organization that had a business associate relationship with
the covered entity to gain access to an existing dataset (Helms, 2008).
International Collaboration
A report by Dutch researchers suggests that the Privacy Rule, or its
interpretation, has made it more difficult for international researchers to
collaborate with U.S. research centers (Kompanje and Maas, 2006). The
authors recorded their experiences operating under the Privacy Rule in an
international, multicenter, Phase III trial on the safety and efficacy of a
neuroprotective agent in traumatic brain injury. The researchers compared
the completion of screening logs between research centers in the United
States and Europe. Because of the Privacy Rule, many of the U.S. screening
logs had a large amount of missing data. All the European sites reported
the actual age of the research participants on their screening logs, but only
5 of the 15 U.S. sites reported the age. The remaining 10 U.S. sites only
reported whether the patient met the inclusion criteria for the study. Also,
all the European sites reported the date and time of the injury, while only
10 U.S. sites provided this information. Information on secondary insults
and the Glasgow Coma Scale were often omitted from the screening logs
of U.S. sites.
Overly conservative or variable interpretations of the Privacy Rule prevented many U.S. sites from providing the requisite data to the researchers
and made it difficult for the researchers to monitor their study for selection
bias and quality (Kompanje and Maas, 2006). In many situations, having
international data is important to study a health problem. How often the
Privacy Rule, or its interpretation, hinders U.S. collaboration in international research is unclear. But it is very conceivable that other international
researchers have experienced frustrations similar to the Dutch researchers
over collecting data from U.S. sites, or have even abandoned attempts to
work with U.S. research centers due to the restrictions of the Privacy Rule.

ABANDONED STUDIES
Some evidence, mostly in the form of case studies and survey results,
shows that researchers have abandoned research studies that they would
have pursued prior to the Privacy Rule. The paucity of systematic analysis is
likely because abandoned research studies are more difficult to measure and
to conclusively document than the other aspects of research that have been
affected by the Privacy Rule. Documenting something that did not happen
(i.e., an abandoned study) is more challenging than measuring something
that did happen (e.g., selection bias, increased inefficiency). One study
that examined abandoned studies in a systematic manner was the study by
O’Herrin et al. (2004), discussed previously. The researchers determined
that 77 percent of research proposals at the University of Wisconsin that
were required to be reviewed by the full IRB, rather than being exempted
from IRB review or receiving expedited review, were abandoned by investigators. The study did not try to tease out the reasons for abandonment or
the appropriateness of abandonment (O’Herrin et al., 2004).
A well-publicized instance of the Privacy Rule leading to studies being
abandoned was outlined in the San Francisco Chronicle. Reporting of ­cancer
cases to the State of California Cancer Registry is required by law and should
not have been affected by the implementation Privacy Rule. However, after
the Privacy Rule became effective, 17 hospitals in the Bay area restricted the
registry’s access to patient data, endangering many ­studies that relied on the
California Cancer Registry for data. For example, a study examining why
African Americans in the Bay Area have a higher risk of lung cancer than
other racial and ethnic groups was nearly abandoned after the Privacy Rule
came into effect because of the difficulty of collecting data (Russell, 2004b).
This problem was created by the hospitals’ overly conservative interpretation of the Privacy Rule, not the actual requirements of the Privacy Rule.
A settlement was eventually reached after 2 years of disagreement, and the
California Cancer Registry now has full access to the files and records of
cancer patients, as is required in all states (Russell, 2004a).
A second instance of an institution’s interpretation of the Privacy Rule
leading to an abandoned study was reported in the Minneapolis Star ­Tribune.
For more than 25 years, researchers at the University of ­Minnesota–Twin
Cities were allowed to access more than 40,000 ­ Minnesotans’ medical
records as part of a longitudinal study into heart attacks and cholesterollowering drugs. This study depended on researchers viewing the medical
records of patients without the individuals’ consent. After the Privacy Rule
was implemented, data collection for this study was put on hold because the
researchers were unable to obtain a waiver of authorization. The ­researchers
decided not to seek additional grant money for the study because it was

unclear whether they could continue without a seriously modified protocol
under the Privacy Rule (Kaiser, 2006; Shaffer, 2006).
In addition, a significant number of researchers surveyed attribute
abandoned studies to the Privacy Rule. In the NAACCR survey, 19 percent
of respondents cited the Privacy Rule as a reason for stopping or preventing
a research project (Howe et al., 2006). In the AHRQ survey, 45 percent of
respondents described a study that had been stopped or altered because the
respondents found it was not possible to redesign a study protocol to comply with the Privacy Rule. Examples of studies that were ended included:
(1) follow-up studies where patients were tracked through a number of
health facilities for services; (2) studies involving community health centers,
community-based mental health and substance abuse programs, and rural
sites; (3) longitudinal studies, where the Privacy Rule requires researchers
to obtain multiple authorizations; and (4) research evaluating government
programs and clinical interventions in order to improve patient population
health (Walker, 2005).
In the HMORN survey of investigators, 65 percent of respondents
agreed that they were hesitant to pursue new study ideas due to the ­Privacy
Rule (Figure 5-6) (Greene et al., 2008). In the AcademyHealth survey,
13 percent of respondents reported that an IRB or Privacy Board has prevented a study in which they were involved from moving forward due to
the IRB or Privacy Board’s concern about violating the Privacy Rule. Ten
percent of respondents said they considered or developed a study, but did
not submit it to the IRB or Privacy Board because they thought it would not
be approved due to their IRB or Privacy Board’s conservative interpretation
of the Privacy Rule (Helms, 2008). In addition, in the ASCO survey, six
investigators said they had abandoned genetic studies on family members of
individuals diagnosed with ­cancer because of difficulty in moving the projects through the IRB approval process. IRBs were most concerned about
the privacy of the ­cancer patients (ASCO, 2008).
DEIDENTIFIED INFORMATION
In drafting the Privacy Rule, HHS specifically excluded ­deidentified information from the definition of PHI (see Chapter 4). In principle, researchers
can access and use deidentified information without patient authorization.
However, many researchers have reported that the deidentifica­tion provisions
of the Privacy Rule do not provide an effective way to obtain health data
for research. The two major problems reported are that researchers have difficulty obtaining deidentified information from covered entities and that data
that have been deidentified according to the Privacy Rule provisions (which
are more stringent than the Common Rule provisions) are of poor quality
and difficult to use in research.

Access to Deidentified Data
Survey data indicate that researchers often have difficulty obtaining
deidentified information from covered entities. In the national survey of epidemiologists, half of the respondents reported accessing ­deidentified information since the Privacy Rule was implemented. Of this half, 40 percent
reported a high level of difficulty in gaining access to this deidentified information (i.e., 4–5 on the Likert scale) (Ness, 2007). In addition, the AHRQ
survey found that 39 percent of respondents reported problems obtaining
deidentified data from covered entities or had problems creating deidentified datasets. Most respondents to the survey also reported concerns about
the use of the statistical method to certify deidentified data. Many were
looking for an alternative option to the “safe harbor” process of deidentification because they believed the resultant datasets were too restrictive for
health services research (Walker, 2005).

232

BEYOND THE HIPAA PRIVACY RULE

The HMORN survey of investigators also found similar results. Of
the respondents, 42 percent reported that accessing deidentified data had
occasionally been difficult, and 13 percent reported that it was “routinely
difficult.” However, in the HMORN survey of IRB administrators, 4 of
the 11 sites reported having individuals on staff who could assist with the
deidentification of data using the statistical method (Greene et al., 2008).
In the AHA/ACC survey, only 32 percent of respondents reported attempting to use deidentified data for research. Of these respondents, 76 percent
reported that the process was difficult (Ring, 2007).
Quality of Deidentified Data
Clause and colleagues (2004) at the Albany College of Pharmacy
designed a study to measure the amount of data that is lost when PHI is
deidentified under the safe harbor provision of the Privacy Rule (see Chapter 4). For this study, the researchers first created a limited dataset from
the pharmacy, administrative, and financial files of patients discharged
from hospitals within the Northeast Health System. A limited dataset is a
collection of health information compiled for research in which 16 direct
identifiers are removed from the PHI (see Chapter 4). A limited dataset
allows researchers to access more information than deidentified information
because the Privacy Rule requires that researchers using a limited dataset
enter into a data use agreement specifying the permitted uses and disclosures of the limited dataset. The researchers then converted the limited
dataset into deidentified information under the safe harbor provision of
the Privacy Rule, which requires removal of 18 personal identifiers. They
measured data lost as a function of unique data elements (UDEs) for both
the limited dataset and the deidentified information.
This study found that a large percentage of data was lost when information was deidentified. The limited dataset represented 4,738 patient discharges and contained 810,456 UDEs in 322,657 records. The deidentified
dataset represented 4,733 patient discharges but only contained 562,171
UDEs. This means that the deidentified dataset contained 31 percent fewer
UDEs than the limited dataset. The researchers reported that much of the
information lost when the information was deidentified was of the type
that is of the most interest to researchers, such as time between episodes of
care. The researchers concluded that deidentified data removes too much
information to produce data useful for conducting good research (Clause
et al., 2004).
Results from the AcademyHealth survey also indicate concern about
the usefulness of deidentified data for research. In this survey, 62 percent
of the respondents reported that the use of deidentified data had a negative
impact on research, 38 percent reported that the removal of the required

233

identifiers interfered somewhat with research, and 21 percent reported
that the removal of identifiers interfered significantly with research. Only 3
percent of the respondents reported that the removal of identifiers did not
interfere with research (Helms, 2008).
AUTHORIZATION PROCESS
The authorization provisions of the Privacy Rule are relevant to health
researchers because although there are some situations in which ­researchers
can obtain PHI without authorization (i.e., by obtaining an IRB/Privacy
Board waiver of authorization, or using limited datasets or deidentified
information), for many research projects, researchers must obtain a signed
authorization form from each research participant (see Chapter 4). Many
researchers have expressed dissatisfaction with how the authorization process has been interpreted and implemented by covered entities. Researchers
report that many IRBs and Privacy Boards require lengthy and complex
wording to describe the authorization within consent forms. They claim
that the extra language added to consent forms is confusing to research participants, burdens the informed consent process, and undermines research
recruitment (AAHC, 2008; Shalowitz and Wendler, 2006).
In the HMORN survey of investigators, 76 percent of respondents
reported that they had incorporated the Privacy Rule’s requirements
for authorization directly into their informed consent forms. However,
in the structured interviews of investigators, all four respondents who
conducted primary data collection reported that they were obliged by
their IRB to augment the consent and authorization procedures for their
studies after the Privacy Rule was implemented. All four investigators
also stated that the Privacy Rule authorization language had an adverse
effect on research recruitment because it increased patient confusion
and frustration. Likewise, in the HMORN survey of IRB administrators, 54.6 percent of respondents stated that study participants are
unduly burdened by the complexity of authorization forms (Greene et
al., 2008).
Studies analyzing the readability of Privacy Rule–compliant authorization forms document the effect of complex authorization forms on
individuals’ willingness to participate in research. In a letter to the editor
of the Annals of Internal Medicine, Breese and colleagues (2004) outlined
an evaluation of the readability and length of authorization forms. The
researchers analyzed the authorization templates from the 125 academic
medical centers receiving the most funding from the National Institutes of
Health and from 31 independent IRBs. First, the authors determined that
the authorization form added an average of two pages of additional material to the informed consent form, or about 744 extra words.

234

BEYOND THE HIPAA PRIVACY RULE

Next, the researchers looked at the authorization forms’ readability using
three formulas: the Simple Measure of Gobbledegook (SMOG), the FleschKincaid reading level, and the Flesch Reading Ease Score. Using the SMOG
formula to evaluate the authorization forms, the researchers found that the
median reading level for the authorization templates was 13th grade (i.e.,
freshman year in college). All of the forms scored above the eighth-grade
reading level. Under the Flesch-Kincaid reading-level formula, the researchers found that 97 percent of the forms were written above the eighth-grade
reading level. Similarly, using the Flesch Reading Ease Score, the researchers
found that 86.5 percent of the forms were “difficult” or “very difficult” to
read. Only 3 of 111 authorization forms scored at the “standard English”
reading level. The authors concluded that these results are problematic for
researchers because half of the U.S. adult population reads at or below the
eighth-grade level. A large percentage of potential research participants are
likely unable to comprehend much of the information contained in authorization forms. The authors believe that many institutions view authorization
forms as liability protection, rather than as a mechanism to inform research
participants about a study (Breese et al., 2004).
A similar study was conducted by Nosowsky and Giordano (2006)
at the University of Michigan. They analyzed the National Institutes of
Health’s model authorization form using Microsoft’s Flesch-Kincaid scale
and found that it was written at a 12th-grade reading level. The authors
concluded that many research participants cannot understand the forms
they are required to sign. Thus, it is not surprising that researchers are
reporting that the authorization process is causing confusion for research
participants (Nosowsky and Giordano, 2006).
Another study that examined whether the Privacy Rule authorization
requirement has created a barrier to research was conducted by Shen et al.
at Governors State University, University Park, IL. The researchers followed
the authorization process in a school-based educational program for childhood obesity prevention as a case study. The authorization form used in
this case study was as simple as possible. Most of the sentences on the form
were taken directly out of the Privacy Rule regulation, and any additional
sentences were required by the local IRB. However, despite an attempt to
simplify the authorization form, only 21 percent of parents granted authorization for their children to participate in the school-based obesity program.
The researchers concluded that the authorization form was overly complex,
making many parents reluctant or unwilling to sign it. The authors noted,
however, that the low recruitment rate recorded perhaps could have been
more easily solved through better communication about the program with
the students’ parents than through modification of the authorization forms
(Shen et al., 2006).

CONCERNS ABOUT POTENTIAL LEGAL CONSEQUENCES
Because many institutions are risk averse, the AcademyHealth survey
examined the impact of concerns about the penalty provisions of the Privacy Rule on research. Nineteen percent of the respondents reported that
the penalties had no effect on efforts to obtain data from a covered entity,
and 24 percent reported that penalties were considered by covered entities
but ultimately did not prevent researchers from obtaining data. However,
26 percent of respondents reported that concerns about penalties have
impeded access to data—16 percent reported that fear of penalties has prevented covered entities from providing data to researchers, and 10 percent
reported that covered entities’ concerns about data privacy caused them to
forego research activities. Nearly 30 percent of respondents were unsure
what impact, if any, penalties have had on efforts to obtain data from
covered entities (Helms, 2008). Similar concerns were reported for a study
using data from 19 hospitals near the University of Washington, as noted
previously. The nine IRBs requiring full review of a study already approved
by the IRB of the University cited concerns over the Privacy Rule’s civil and
criminal penalties as the main reason for denying expedited review or for
not honoring another IRB’s decisions (Lydon-Rochelle and Holt, 2004).
Fear of civil suits could also lead IRB and Privacy Board members to be
overly conservative in their decisions about research proposals brought before
them, and could be a significant deterrent in recruiting qualified volunteers
to serve on IRBs and Privacy Boards. Effective oversight of health research
depends on the recruitment of qualified and knowledgeable volunteers to
serve on IRBs and Privacy Boards, but the growth over the past decade of
lawsuits naming individual IRB members as defendants has created a chill
that threatens the willingness of volunteers to serve on IRBs (Hoffman and
Berg, 2005; Icenogle, 2003; IPPC, 2008; Rose and Lodato, 2004; Shaul et
al., 2005). Members of IRBs and Privacy Boards are generally indemnified by
their institutions, but they are not immune from being named in a suit. Therefore they could still have to devote time and resources to defending themselves
for decisions made by an IRB or a Privacy Board on which they served.
Potential Ways to Reduce INTERPRETIVE Variability
Among IRBs, Privacy Boards, and Covered Entities
HHS intended to allow covered entities, IRBs, and Privacy Boards to
have some local control in implementing and interpreting the Privacy Rule
as it applies to the use and disclosure of PHI for research. Sensitivity to local

issues can be a desirable feature, particularly when institutions serve special
populations or under unusual circumstances. However, variations in IRB
and Privacy Board oversight may relate less to true local differences in the
research environment than to the administrative differences and ­variability
in the skills and resources of IRBs and Privacy Boards (Casarett et al.,
2005). There is no required certification process to ensure that IRB/Privacy
Board members have sufficient knowledge and understanding of research
ethics and regulation, and funding is often through indirect sources, such
as grants.
Based on the evidence presented in this chapter, it is clear that overinterpretation of the Privacy Rule is common and that the substantial
variability in interpretation among covered entities and oversight boards is
detrimental to health research. More consistent application of the Privacy
Rule would facilitate responsible research and also provide more meaningful protection of patient privacy. One potential way to begin to address
this issue would be for HHS to regularly identify and disseminate “best
practices” for responsible research (IOM, 2000). Guidance materials and
models or templates for things such as the authorization form (written
at an appropriate reading level), waiver of authorization form, data use
agreements, and business associate agreements would make it easier for
investigators to appropriately design research projects and put institutions
at ease about decisions their IRBs and Privacy Boards make with regard
to privacy concerns. This endeavor could perhaps be accomplished as an
activity of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Roadmap, under the
direction of the Office for Civil Rights. An informative precedent for this
activity is the National Practitioner Data Bank Guidebook of the Health
Resources and Services Administration, established through Title IV of the
Healthcare Quality Improvement Act of 1986, Public Law 99–660. That
guidebook, which is frequently updated, provides many case examples of
what should be done in various situations.
Stakeholders—including researchers; research institutions, IRBs, and
Privacy Boards; sponsors of research; public health practitioners and agencies; patient and consumer organizations; and privacy experts—could have
considerable influence on the adoption of best practices once they have been
identified and thus could help to make privacy protections and IRB/Privacy
Board decisions more uniform. For example, Requests for Proposals and
other funding mechanisms could be more instructive on this point. Many

academic researchers depend on their ability to procure funding from a
source external to their institutions, and research sponsors also have obligations to protect research participants. As a result, major nonfederal funders
could be a powerful force for adherence to ethical guidelines, even in the
absence of strong federal regulations and enforcement.
Organizations whose primary missions are focused on promoting
responsible and ethical research, such as Public Responsibility in Medicine and Research (PRIM&R) and the Association for the Accreditation
of Human Research Protection Programs (AAHRPP), featured in Boxes
5-2 and 5-3, could contribute much to the dynamic and ongoing process
of developing best practices. These organizations educate IRB professionals, offer voluntary certification programs, and have hosted conferences to
address ethical and legal challenges in research, including those related to
HIPAA. Increased participation in PRIM&R and AAHRPP could extend
understanding of regulatory requirements and foster national discourse
about issues of interpretation and application of the Privacy Rule.
An important point to remember is that HHS’s policy is to seek compliance first, rather than penalties, when a concern is brought to the agency’s
attention (see Chapter 5). Institutions might be less inclined to be overly
conservative in interpreting the Privacy Rule if this were stated more clearly

BOX 5-2
Public Responsibility in Medicine and Research (PRIM&R)
The mission of PRIM&R is to promote ethical research in humans and animals.
It tracks and provides input to policy initiatives and regulatory changes relating to
ethical standards in research and offers educational opportunities in the fields of
biomedical and social/behavioral/educational research. PRIM&R also offers two
certification programs, one for administrators for animal care and use committees,
and one for IRB professionals.
The latter is designed specifically for individuals participating in and/or overseeing the daily operations of IRBs, including IRB administrators, staff, chairs,
and institutional officials. Professionals from institutional IRBs, independent IRBs,
and industry, as well as other institutions focused on either biomedical or social/
behavioral/educational research, are eligible. Candidates’ IRB experience must
be “substantial and ongoing” and must reflect the applicant’s commitment to
applied research ethics in human subjects protections. The exam for certification
is administered by the Professional Testing Corporation and is offered at least
twice yearly at testing sites across the United States and Canada. Certification is
valid for 3 years and can be renewed via reexamination or once in a 6-year period
with continuing education credits.

BOX 5-3
Association for the Accreditation of Human
Research Protection Programs (AAHRPP)
AAHRPP is an independent, nonprofit entity that accredits organizations’ human research protection programs. Its mission is to accredit “highquality human research protection programs in order to promote excellent,
ethically sound research. Through partnership with research organizations,
researchers, sponsors, and the public, AAHRPP encourages effective, efficient, and innovative systems of protection for human research participants.”
To earn and maintain accreditation, an organization must provide evidence
that its practices, policies, and procedures promote ethically sound and scientific research every 3 years. AAHRPP provides print, online, and training
resources to guide organizations through the accreditation process and to
help organizations interpret the required accreditation standards.

in guidance materials. Simple clarification and clear communication of
the way HHS will enforce the Privacy Rule and seek penalties would be
helpful.
In addition, some limited protection against civil suits brought pursuant to federal or state law for members of IRBs and Privacy Boards for
decisions made within the scope of their responsibilities under the Privacy
Rule and the Common Rule could be beneficial. This limited protection
should not include protection for willful and wanton misconduct in reviewing the research. Members of IRBs or Privacy Boards who receive limited
protection against lawsuits may be less likely to interpret the Privacy Rule
too conservatively. A similar provision was incorporated into the Ontario
Personal Health Information Protection Act of 2004, under which members
of Research Ethics Boards are immune for acts done and omissions made in
good faith that are reasonable under the circumstances (see also Chapter 6).
This type of immunity for IRB and Privacy Board members would be similar to the precedent of protection for peer review members under state laws
and under the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986.
Such protections might also facilitate multi-institutional research by
reducing the variability among local IRBs and Privacy Boards because they
might be more comfortable accepting the decision of a lead IRB/­Privacy
Board. But even in the absence of this sort of regulatory or statutory

239

change, a clear statement from HHS regarding the acceptability, and thus
the limits, of legal consequences of accepting the decision of another IRB or
Privacy Board would help to facilitate multi-institutional research.
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The evidence presented in this chapter demonstrates that implementation and interpretation of the Privacy Rule has had a significant effect on
how health research is conducted in the United States. Although the Privacy Rule may have extended regulatory protections of privacy in health
research that were desirable, the numerous studies reviewed here indicate
that it has also had an unintended negative effect on health research, often
due to variations in how covered entities, IRBs, and Privacy Boards interpret the complex regulations. Nonetheless, even if the effect on research has
been negative, carefully considering the effect on privacy of any changes
to the Privacy Rule as well as the effect on research is important. Many
problems identified in this chapter could potentially be improved by HHS
without changing the Privacy Rule itself.
More consistent application of the Privacy Rule would facilitate
responsible research and provide more meaningful protection of patient
privacy. Thus, the committee recommends that HHS regularly convene
consensus development conferences in collaboration with health research
stake­holders to collect and evaluate current practices in privacy protection in order to identify and disseminate best practices for responsible
research. Stake­holders can then enable and encourage researchers to use
these best practices in designing and conducting research involving the
use of PHI.
Current guidance from HHS addresses only what is permissible under
the HIPAA Privacy Rule; the guidance does not identify best practices. A
dynamic, ongoing process for the identification and dissemination of best
practices in privacy protection for various types of health research by HHS
would facilitate reviews by IRBs and Privacy Boards and would lead to
more consistent and appropriate decisions. Guidance materials with best
practices and models or templates for things such as the authorization form,
waiver of authorization form, data use agreements, and business associate
agreements would make it easier for investigators to appropriately design
research projects and put institutions at ease about decisions their IRBs and
Privacy Boards make with regard to privacy concerns. Such guidance materials should be written as clearly and simply as possible, using an inclusive,
dynamic, and transparent development process, and should override all
prior guidance documents.

Privacy Boards; sponsors of research; public health practitioners and agen-

cies; patient and consumer organizations; and privacy experts—could have
considerable influence on the adoption of best practices once they have been
identified and thus could help to make privacy protections and IRB/Privacy
Board decisions more uniform. Organizations whose primary missions are
focused on promoting responsible and ethical research, such as PRIM&R
and AAHRPP, can contribute much to the process.
Another potential way to reduce inconsistency and overly conservative
interpretation would be to provide some limited legal protection for IRB
and Privacy Board members, who may be fearful of lawsuits pertaining to
IRB/Privacy Board decisions. The committee recommends that HHS—or,
as necessary, Congress—provide reasonable protection against civil suits
brought pursuant to federal or state law for members of IRBs and Privacy
Boards for decisions made within the scope of their responsibilities under
the HIPAA Privacy Rule and the Common Rule. The limitation on liability
should not include protection for willful and wanton misconduct in reviewing the research, but should instead be for good-faith decisions, backed by
minutes or other evidence, in responsibly applying the legal requirements
under the HIPAA Privacy Rule or the Common Rule.
Recommendations put forth in previous chapters should also help to
reduce variability and overinpretation of the regulations. These include
facilitating greater use of data with direct identifiers removed and facilitating appropriate IRB and Privacy Board oversight of identification and
recruitment of potential research participants (see Chapter 4). Clarifying
the distinction between “research” and “practice” to ensure appropriate
ethical oversight of the use of protected health information would also help
IRBs and Privacy Boards make decisions that adequately protect patient
privacy and facilitate responsible research (see Chapter 3).
However, as indicated in Chapter 6, the committee believes that ideally,
a bolder approach should be taken, with HHS developing a new approach
to protecting privacy in health research that emphasizes privacy, security,
accountability, and transparency and that is applicable to all health research
in the United States.

A New Framework for Protecting
Privacy in Health Research

In the previous chapters of this report, the committee put forth several
recommendations that aim to improve the Privacy Rule and associated
guidance in order to ease the impact on health research while still protecting patient privacy. However, in the process of developing these recommendations, the committee recognized that the Privacy Rule’s research
provisions have many serious limitations and concluded that a new, more
uniform approach is needed to accomplish the dual challenge of protecting
privacy while facilitating beneficial and responsible research. In this chapter, the committee recommends that the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services (HHS) exempt health research from the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule and lays out the
details of a bold and innovative framework for protecting privacy in health
research.
The overall purpose of this Institute of Medicine (IOM) study was to
examine the effects of the HIPAA Privacy Rule on health research and to
recommend improvements to the legislative and regulatory system accordingly. To achieve this task, the IOM convened a committee to include individuals with a broad range of expertise and experience relevant to the stated
goal of the project, including individuals with knowledge of the various
fields of health research, privacy and human research protections, health
law, health center administration, use and protection of electronic health
information, and patient advocacy (see Chapter 1 for complete statement
of task and the Front Matter for committee membership).
The committee held a number of information-gathering meetings that
were open to the public. During those meetings, the committee heard pre245

BEYOND THE HIPAA PRIVACY RULE

sentations on privacy in research and public health; the use of information
systems to protect privacy; the effect of the Privacy Rule on various research
disciplines, including those that are exclusively information based, such as
health services research; the Ontario health privacy law; harmonization of
the Privacy Rule and the Common Rule (see Chapter 3); challenges associated with the Privacy Rule’s regulation of biorepositories, databases, and
future research; and the relationship between privacy and autonomy in
health research. The committee also reviewed the information presented in
an earlier IOM workshop on the same topic (IOM, 2006) and conducted an
extensive review of the literature. Members of the public were permitted to
submit relevant references and written comments on their experiences with
the Privacy Rule’s regulation of research and to speak at the committee’s
public meetings. In addition, because there was a paucity of quantitative
and systematic data on the effect of the Privacy Rule on research, the committee commissioned a number of large-scale, evidence-gathering projects
to inform the committee’s deliberations (see Chapter 5 and Appendix B).
After reviewing the available evidence, the committee concluded that
a new framework for protecting privacy in health research is needed. The
current system of regulating research and protecting privacy under the
Privacy Rule is not working as well as it should to protect patient privacy
in research, and as currently implemented, it impedes important research.
The committee believes a different system could work better and provide
improved privacy protections and stronger data security while also facilitating beneficial and responsible research.
In thinking about a new framework, the committee recognized that the
goals of safeguarding privacy and enhancing health research are sometimes
in tension. Stringent measures to safeguard privacy can make it harder to
conduct high-quality research, and research itself can pose a threat to privacy. Yet the committee believes that there is a synergy between the two,
that facilitating both is desirable, and that it is possible to strengthen certain
privacy protections while still facilitating important health research.
For that reason, the committee’s intent in developing the new framework
was to advance both privacy and health research interests to the greatest
extent possible. The committee understands that the lines are not neat, the
questions are complex, and the challenges are formidable. Nevertheless, the
new framework aims to strengthen health research regulations and practices
that effectively safeguard personally identifiable health information, and
to facilitate data collection and use for beneficial and high-quality health
research, with appropriate oversight, to advance knowledge about human
health.
This chapter reviews the major goals the committee agreed on during
its deliberations and describes how they should be incorporated into a new
regulatory system for health research and privacy. First, the chapter will

highlight the major problems with the Privacy Rule’s regulation of health
research, as identified in the earlier chapters of the report. Second, the
chapter will lay out the details of the new framework that the committee is
recommending. Third, the committee will explain its rationale for developing the proposed framework, address potential criticism of this model, and
explain how the new framework avoids many of the problems associated
with the Privacy Rule.
Review of the Limitations of the Privacy Rule
In the earlier chapters of this report, the committee identified three
overarching goals on which to ground the recommendations: (1) improve
the privacy and data security of health information, (2) improve the effectiveness of health research, and (3) improve the application of privacy
protections for health research (see Box 6-1). In the process of recommending changes to the HIPAA Privacy Rule to achieve these three goals, the
committee identified many serious problems with the current regulatory
system. This section reviews the most serious problems with the Privacy
Rule’s regulation of health research and protection of privacy in terms of
these overarching goals.
Improve the Privacy and Data Security of Health Information
In the context of health research, the privacy goal entails the commitment to handle personal information of patients and research participants in accordance with meaningful privacy protections. These protections
should include strong security measures, disclosure of the purposes for
which personally identifiable health information is used (transparency),
and legally enforceable obligations to ensure information is secure and used
appropriately (accountability). The Privacy Rule falls short of the privacy
goal for health research in two important ways: (1) it overstates the ability
of informed consent (authorization) to protect privacy, and (2) it does not
provide other meaningful methods of protecting privacy, such as effective
security, accountability, and transparency.
Overemphasis on Informed Consent
The principle of autonomy currently dominates the ethical landscape
for both medical care and clinical research in the United States and serves as
 The term “personally identifiable health information” is used when discussing individual’s
health data in a context independent of the HIPAA Privacy Rule or any other body of law.
 In the Privacy Rule, the informed consent concept is referred to as “authorization.”

BEYOND THE HIPAA PRIVACY RULE

BOX 6-1
The Committee’s Three Overarching Goals
Improve the Privacy and Data Security of Health Information
In the context of health research, protection of privacy includes a commitment to handle personal information of patients and research participants with
meaningful privacy protections, including strong security measures, transparency,
and accountability. This commitment extends to everyone who collects, uses, or
has access to personally identifiable health information of patients and research
participants.
Practices of security, transparency, and accountability take on extraordinary
importance in the health research setting: Researchers and other data users
should disclose clearly how and why personally identifiable health information is
being collected, used, and secured, and should be subject to legally enforceable
obligations to ensure that personal information is used appropriately and securely.
In this manner, privacy protection will help to ensure research participant and
public trust and confidence in medical research.
Improve the Effectiveness of Health Research
Research discoveries are central to achieving the goal of extending the ­quality
of healthy lives. Research into causes of disease, methods for prevention, techniques for diagnosis, and new approaches to treatment has increased life expectancy, reduced infant mortality, limited the toll of infectious diseases, and improved
outcomes for patients with heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and other chronic
diseases. Patient-oriented clinical research that tests new ideas makes rapid
medical and public health progress possible.
Today the rate of discovery is accelerating, and we are at the precipice of a
remarkable period of investigative promise made possible by new knowledge
about the genetic underpinnings of disease. Genomic research is opening new
possibilities for preventing illness and for developing safer, more effective medical care that can be tailored for specific individuals. Further advances in relating
genetic information to predispositions to disease and responses to treatments
will require use of large amounts of existing health-related information and stored
biological specimens. The increasing use of electronic medical records will further facilitate the generation of new knowledge through research and accelerate
the pace of discovery. These efforts will require broad participation of patients in
research to ensure that the results are valid and applicable to different segments
of the population. Collaborative partnerships among communities of patients, their

A NEW FRAMEWORK FOR PROTECTING PRIVACY

Improve the Application of Privacy Protections for Health Research
The HIPAA Privacy Rule was written to provide consistent standards in the United
States for the use and disclosure of protected health information (PHI) by covered
entities, including the use and disclosure of such information for research purposes.
In its current state, however, the HIPAA Privacy Rule is difficult to reconcile with other
federal regulations, including U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
regulations for the protection of human subjects (the Common Rule), Food and Drug
Administration regulations pertaining to human subjects, and other applicable federal
or state laws.
Inconsistencies, for example, in federal regulations governing the deidentification of personally identifiable health information, obtaining individuals’ consent for
future research, and the recruitment of research volunteers make it challenging
for health r­esearchers seeking to comply with all these regulations to undertake
important research activities. In addition, there is substantial variation in the way
in which institutions interpret and apply the Privacy Rule. For example, the way in
which Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) interpret the provisions when making decisions about authorization requirements varies across institutions, and often is quite
conservative. Especially for multisite research and studies that are reviewed by
both IRBs and Privacy Boards, the inconsistent interpretation and application of the
Privacy Rule’s provisions pertaining to research can create barriers to research and
even lead to the discontinuation of ongoing research studies. Adding yet another
layer of complexity and variability for health researchers is a lack of clarity in the way
the Privacy Rule applies to various types of health research or closely related health
care practices. Moreover, there are significant gaps in who and what is covered by
current federal research regulations. Whether a research activity is subject to the
provisions of the Privacy Rule or the Common Rule depends on a number of factors,
including the source of funding, the source of the data, and whether the researcher
meets the definition of a covered entity.
The situation in the United States is in stark contrast to the situation in most
other countries, where uniform regulations apply to all research conducted in the
country. The committee believes a new direction is needed, with a more uniform
approach to patient protections, including privacy, in health research. Improved
clarity, harmonization, and uniform application of regulations governing health
research are needed to align the interests and understandings of the research
community, the custodians of PHI, and other stakeholders, so that implementation of the privacy protections in health research can be achieved with acceptability by all.

the justification for the doctrine of informed consent (i.e., authorization) in
the Privacy Rule. Historically, informed consent was based on the idea that
“every human being of adult years and sound mind has a right to determine
what shall be done with his own body.” It was ­ primarily considered a
protection against physical harm, permitting informed, competent patients
to refuse unwanted medical interventions, to choose among medically available alternatives, and to make choices that conflict with the wishes of family
members or the recommendations of physicians (Buchanan, 1999; Lo, in
press). Under this system, a great deal of information-based health research
was conducted using personally identifiable health records without the
informed consent of the persons whose records were used.
Several recent developments have brought attention to this practice,
and have focused attention on the historical absence of patient autonomy
in information-based research. First, the increased used of electronic health
records has made it significantly easier for researchers to access large quantities of personally identifiable data. Second, the move towards personalized medicine, and the potential improvements to population health and
health care that could be developed based on a better understanding of the
determinants of health and illness, have increased researchers’ needs for
personally identifiable health information.
Under the Privacy Rule the concept of informed consent is extended
beyond control of one’s body, to control of one’s health information in an
attempt to address the historical lack of informational autonomy, and with
the goal of protecting individuals against the nonphysical harm of unauthorized uses or disclosures of their protected health information. However,
consent (authorization) itself cannot achieve the separate aim of privacy
protection. The Privacy Rule, as currently defined and operationalized in
practice, does not provide effective privacy safeguards for informationbased research because of an over-reliance on informed consent, rather than
comprehensive privacy protections.
The Limitations of Relying on Consent to Protect Privacy
As has been described above, the protection of medical privacy in
the data processing environment requires the adoption of comprehensive
privacy protections, which establish a variety of obligations on entities
that collect and use personal information. These obligations to safeguard
privacy, such as security, transparency, and accountability, are independent
of patient consent. In fact, preventing the secondary use of personal data is
the only privacy obligation that consent can potentially address. However,

A NEW FRAMEWORK FOR PROTECTING PRIVACY

informed consent has recently been put forward as an alternative to the
adoption of comprehensive privacy protections, with the practical consequence that many privacy obligations are ignored (Allen, 2007; Rotenberg,
2001; Solove et al., 2006) (see the section on Other Federal Actions for
examples of currently proposed bills). This section describes some of the
major limitations of relying ­heavily on informed consent to protect informational privacy, as is done in the HIPAA Privacy Rule, rather than requiring the implementation of a full range of privacy protections.
With a primary focus on informed consent in privacy laws, many
entities that hold personal health data may have insufficient incentives to
implement comprehensive privacy protections. If compliance with consent requirements frees the data holders from further privacy obligations,
some organizations and researchers may be less likely to invest in privacy­enhancing technologies or the infrastructure necessary to truly protect data.
This emphasis also creates few reasons for organizations to make their
activities transparent or to create institutional accountability (AHIC, 2008;
Cate, 2008; CDT, 2008a,b; U.S. Congress, 2008a).
In addition, although informed consent can allow patients to control
whether their information is used for any secondary purposes, such as
research, few patients are sufficiently informed to make educated decisions
about how their data should be used (Schneider, 2006). Studies indicate that
many consumers do not read the details of informed consent forms, which
are often lengthy documents, and even when they do read the forms they
often do not comprehend all the details (Cate, 2008). Two separate studies have found that many consumers mistake the existence of any privacy
policy for a guarantee that information will be strongly protected and withheld from outside persons, even if the consent says differently (Good et al.,
2005; Turow et al., 2007). This difficulty is magnified by the fact that often
patients are asked to give informed consent at a time when they are not in
good health and are not motivated or lack the ability to make these kinds
of complicated decisions (CDT, 2008b; U.S. Congress, 2008a).
Relying heavily on informed consent rather than comprehensive privacy
obligations may also lead to a shift from substantive privacy protections
toward costly procedural requirements that actually provide consumers
with few meaningful choices, especially if informed consent is required as
a condition of obtaining services (Cate, 2008; Thomas and Walport, 2008).
Data holders may offer blanket consents to shield themselves from liability
without actually providing any substantial privacy protection. In these
situations patients lack reasonable alternatives and are forced to relinquish
control over how their health information is used (CDT, 2008a,b; Thomas
and Walport, 2008; U.S. Congress, 2008a,b).
In the case of medical records research, it is questionable as to whether
a reliance on informed consent actually fosters patient confidentiality and

252

BEYOND THE HIPAA PRIVACY RULE

protection (AMS, 2006, 2008; Casarett et al., 2005; Thomas and Walport,
2008). For example, if individuals must be contacted each time their records
may be used in a particular study in order to obtain informed consent, as
the Privacy Rule requires, such contact could be considered intrusive and
counter to the tenets of confidentiality. Also, a common methodological
approach to studying disease is to compare people with a particular disease
to people who do not have that disease—known as a case-control study. But
people may become alarmed if they are asked to consent to their records
being used in such a study on a particular disease (e.g., cancer) for which
they have not been diagnosed (Casarett et al., 2005).
Because of these limitations, the committee believes it is important to
shift the focus in privacy protections toward a set of more comprehensive
privacy obligations. This will ensure that health information privacy protections are more robust and more likely to minimize the risks to personal
privacy that result from the collection of personally identifiable health
information.
Failure to Incorporate Other Meaningful Privacy Protections
Implementation of the Privacy Rule does not ensure that covered entities or the research community will adopt a full range of measures to protect
data; the security, transparency, and accountability provisions have proven
ineffectual. As highlighted in Chapter 2, the HIPAA Security Rule does lay
out a number of security requirements that covered entities must implement
for protecting electronic protected health information. However, despite
this regulation, there have been a number of highly publicized examples
of data security breaches in health research, most often due to stolen or
misplaced computers containing health data. A recent survey conducted by
Campus Computing Project found that from 2006 to 2007, colleges of all
types saw a 3.6 percent increase in the number of stolen computers with
sensitive data. This problem was most prevalent at major research universities (Foster, 2008). Also, a report from the Identity Theft Resource Center
found that identity thefts are up 69 percent for the first half of 2008, compared to the same time period in 2007, and so the consequences of security
breaches are more likely to lead to tangible harm than previously believed
(ITRC, 2008). These facts suggest that holders of personally identifiable
health data should be required to implement security safeguards beyond
what is provided for under the current HIPAA Security Rule.
In addition, as discussed in Chapter 4, it has been argued that the
current interpretation of the Privacy Rule has not successfully resulted in
accountability for misuses and unauthorized disclosures of protected health
information. The regulation provides both civil and criminal penalties for
covered entities that breach the Privacy Rule, but enforcement of the Pri-

A NEW FRAMEWORK FOR PROTECTING PRIVACY

253

vacy Rule has been criticized as inadequate. To date, there have been no
civil penalties imposed against any covered entity and only three criminal
prosecutions, despite the fact that between April 2003 and August 2008,
more than 38,000 complaints were received by HHS regarding alleged
violations of the Privacy Rule. HHS has not provided information on how
many of these alleged violations are in the context of health research (HHS,
2008a; Rahman, 2006). On July 18, 2008, HHS required a monetary payment to settle potential violations of the Privacy and Security Rules for the
first time, signaling that HHS may start to take a more assertive approach
to enforcement of the Privacy and Security Rules in the future (HHS,
2008b). This agreement was in response to the covered entity allowing
backup tapes, optical disks, and laptops—containing unencrypted protected
health information on 386,000 patients—to be stolen or lost.
Finally, the accounting for disclosures provision of the Privacy Rule was
intended to make covered entities’ actions open and transparent (discussed
in Chapter 4). This provision gives individuals the right to receive a list of
certain disclosures that a covered entity has made of their protected health
information in the past 6 years, including disclosures made for research
purposes. However, this requirement has numerous exceptions. Also, for
research involving groups of 50 or more, covered entities are only required
to produce a general list of all protocols for which a person’s protected
health information may have been disclosed, but do not have to provide
any more specific information. Therefore, the accounting for disclosures
provision does not require covered entities to provide individuals with a
clear description of how their health information is used, and does not
provide individuals with the detailed information they may want (AHIC,
2007; Pritts, 2008). At the same time, survey data show that this provision
is a considerable administrative obligation for covered entities, and is rarely
requested by patients (AHIMA, 2006; see also Chapter 4).
Improve the Effectiveness of Health Research
The health research goal emphasizes the importance of research in
extending high-quality, healthy lives, and in leading to improved methods
for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Unfortunately, the available evidence indicates that the current interpretation and implementation of the
Privacy Rule has had an unintended negative impact on health research. As
discussed in Chapter 5, the Privacy Rule, as interpreted and implemented
by covered entities, has:

Increased the cost and time needed to conduct a research project
from start to finish
Made recruitment of research participants more difficult
Increased the likelihood of selection bias and made it more difficult

Increased research participants’ confusion regarding their rights
and protections
Led researchers to abandon important studies
Created new barriers to the use of patient specimens collected during clinical trials or treatment
Failed to create an effective way for researchers to conduct studies
using data with direct identifiers removed

These negative consequences are particularly problematic in light of
recent trends in health care and research. Since the Privacy Rule was implemented, health data have assumed an even greater role in health research,
and will become more essential as health care administration moves toward
personalized medicine, in which preventive and therapeutic interventions
are tailored to the individual characteristics of patients. Developing drug
therapies and treatment protocols that focus on smaller and smaller subsets
of the population based on genetic makeup or health history and environmental exposures requires access to more and more personal data to
conduct effective health research. In addition, burgeoning health care costs
and increasing limitations on expenditures by health care plans highlight
the need for health services research to better determine which patients
benefit from current approaches and which patients may even be harmed.
If the current approach to privacy protection in research under the Privacy
Rule continues unchanged, these advances will be burdened and potentially
delayed, and opportunities for medical progress may be lost.
Alternative models The challenges described above are causing some leading scientists, legal experts, and privacy advocates to develop new paradigms for determining when personally identifiable health data, including
biological samples, can be used for research. The recognition that a primary
focus on consent is not always meaningful or protective of privacy, and that
it impedes important information-based research, is gaining acknowledgment in the United ­Kingdom and in other countries in Europe, as well as
the United States (AMS, 2006, 2008; Thomas and Walport, 2008). The
committee reviewed several alternative models and took them into consideration in the development of the proposed new framework for protecting
privacy in health research.
•

Reciprocity, Solidarity, and Mutuality Models. These models

seek to address the situation where there is no consent for future
research uses (whether specified or unspecified). Proponents of
the reciprocity model argue that by accepting the benefit of past
medical research (which is intrinsic in the use of medical services), patients inherently agree to allow the use of their health
information in future research for the common good (Knoppers
and Chadwick, 2005; Liu, 2007). Critics of this approach argue
that voluntary altruism by past research participants imposes no
reciprocal obligation on the larger community (Jonas, 1991). Proponents of the solidarity model similarly argue that individual ties
to society and social relationships require individuals to participate in research without informed consent for the common good
(Chadwick and Berg, 2001). The mutuality model is based on the
insurance industry’s concept of individuals entering a pool for
sharing losses and known risks. In the research context, mutuality
requires indi­viduals to pool their health information for the benefit
of all, rather than provide for discretionary control of individual
information ­(Knoppers and Chadwick, 2005).
Harms-Based Model. The harms-based model seeks to narrowly
tailor the restrictions that are applied to the use of personally identifiable health information based on the specific risks associated with
unauthorized use of that information. There are two categories of
potential harm commonly cited with respect to ­ unauthorized uses
of personally identifiable health information: (1) discrimination and
stigmatization and (2) erosion of trust leading to compromises in
health care (NCVHS, 2007). For example, such an approach would
logically call for the adoption of nondiscrimination legislation and
a requirement that entities with a legitimate need for personally
identifiable health information secure the information against further
unauthorized access. This would arguably address directly the risks
of harm to the individuals involved when their personally identifiable
health information is used for research, while recognizing the need
for researchers’ access to information in order to achieve the public’s
goals of improving individual and public health and advancing scientific knowledge.

Improve the Application of Privacy Protections for Health Research
The goal of improving the application of privacy protections for health
research stresses the need for consistent standards for the use and disclosure
of personally identifiable health information in health research. The extent
of privacy protections should not depend on the holder of the personally
identifiable health information, the source of the data, or what type of fund-

ing is supporting the research project. In addition, all institutions required to
comply with the privacy protections should ideally interpret and implement
them in a consistent manner. Major problems identified with the Privacy
Rule’s regulation of research under this principle include: (1) discrepancies
between the Privacy Rule and other rules and regulations relevant to health
research, (2) the Privacy Rule’s limitation in scope, and (3) large variations
in interpretation and implementation by covered entities.
Discrepancies with Other Rules That Regulate Research
The Privacy Rule was intended to provide consistent standards in the
United States for the use and disclosure of protected health information,
including for research purposes. However, in the current state, the Privacy
Rule is difficult to reconcile with HHS regulations for the Protection of
Human Subjects (45 C.F.R. 46), the Food and Drug Administration human
subjects regulation (21 C.F.R. parts 50 and 56), and other applicable federal
and state laws. For example, the provisions governing data deidentification,
consent for future research, and recruitment of research volunteers vary
among these regulations, making important research activities more challenging to undertake (see Chapter 4).
Limitation in Scope
The Privacy Rule pertains only to covered entities; thus this regulation does not apply uniformly to all health research in the United States
(see Chapter 4). Similarly, as described in Chapter 3, the Common Rule
only applies to research conducted or supported by the U.S. government
(although its influence is broader because most institutions that accept
federal funds sign a federalwide assurance to abide by the Common Rule
requirements in all research conducted at the institution, regardless of
funding source). Because both of these Rules are limited in scope, there are
significant gaps in whom and what is covered by current federal research
regulations. This is in stark contrast to most other countries, in which
research regulations are not limited by provisions regarding funding or particular health care transactions, but instead apply to all research conducted
in that country (Casarett et al., 2005).
Differences in Interpretation
Because the Privacy Rule is such a complex regulation, there is substantial variation across institutions in how the Privacy Rule has been
interpreted and implemented (see Chapter 5). For example, the way in
which Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) and Privacy Boards interpret

A NEW FRAMEWORK FOR PROTECTING PRIVACY

257

the concepts of impracticability and minimal risk when making decisions
about authorization requirements varies across institutions, and often is
quite conservative (see Chapter 4). Inconsistent interpretation and application of the Privacy Rule research provisions by IRBs, Privacy Boards, and
covered entities that hold the protected health information, especially for
multisite research and studies that are reviewed by multiple IRBs and Privacy Boards, can create barriers to research such as variations in protocol
at different institutions and, at times, discontinuation of studies. A lack of
clarity in how the Privacy Rule applies to various types of health research
or closely related health care practices adds another layer of complexity and
variability (see Chapter 3). In fact, some covered entities are reluctant to
permit access to data for research even when all provisions of the Privacy
Rule are followed, out of fear of misinterpreting the Privacy Rule (Casarett
et al., 2005; Rothstein, 2005).
The New Framework
Given the clear limitations of the HIPAA Privacy Rule, the committee concluded that a new approach to the regulation of health research
is needed. The committee favors an approach in which both individual
privacy and the societal value of research are carefully considered and
supported. To achieve this goal, the committee identified a number of key
concepts (CIHR, 2005; Gostin, 2001) to incorporate into the new framework, including:
•
•
•

•
•
•

All researchers should be required to follow the same set of privacy
rules.
Whenever possible, information-based research should be done
using health data with direct identifiers removed.
Access to personally identifiable health data without patient consent should require impartial, outside scientific and ethical review
that considers:
— Measures taken to protect the privacy, security, and confidentiality of the data;
— Potential harms that could result from disclosure of the data;
and
— Potential public benefits of the research.
Researchers should identify and document research objectives to
justify the data they wish to use and/or collect.
Researchers, institutions, and organizations that store personally
identifiable health data should establish security safeguards and set
limits on access to data.
Researchers who violate individuals’ privacy should be penalized.

258

BEYOND THE HIPAA PRIVACY RULE

These concepts are intended to support the beneficial use of existing health
data, as well as the collection and use of health data for research purposes,
while protecting individuals’ privacy.
Examples of Informative Models
One informative example that incorporates many of the privacy principles listed above is Ontario’s Personal Health Information Protection
Act (PHIPA). This provincial law governs the manner in which “personal
health information” is collected, used, and disclosed within the Ontario
health care system. PHIPA only applies to the province of Ontario (not
the entire country) and operates in a universal health care system, so the
legislation as a whole may not be easily transferable to the United States.
However, many of the major concepts in PHIPA influenced the committee’s
deliberations regarding the new framework.
PHIPA shares a number of similarities with the Privacy Rule (Table 6-1).
In general, both regulations require the holder of personally identifiable
health data to obtain informed consent (referred to as authorization in the
Privacy Rule) before using any personally identifiable health information
for a purpose other than providing services directly related to health care
of the patient. If a researcher wishes to use personally identifiable health
data without informed consent, both regulations require the researcher to
obtain a waiver of informed consent approved by an independent ethics
board prior to the start of the study.
Despite these similarities, the Privacy Rule and PHIPA have some key
differences that are important in research. One major difference is that
unlike the Privacy Rule, which applies privacy obligations unevenly across
the health care sector, PHIPA implements a more uniform approach. PHIPA
applies to health information custodians (HICs) (e.g., providers, hospitals,
and pharmacies) who collect, use, and disclose personal health information and to non-HICs when they receive personal health information from
a HIC. This means that the privacy protections follow the data, even after
the data are no longer held by a HIC. All health researchers are required to
comply with PHIPA when using personal health information. In contrast,
the Privacy Rule fails to provide individuals with privacy protections if their
information is held by an entity other than a covered entity. Only some
researchers qualify as covered entities or are employed by covered entities
 Personal Health Information Protection Act, Statutes of Ontario 2004, Ch. 3, Schedule A;

Ontario Regulation 329/04.
 PHIPA defines personal health information as “identifying information about an individual
in oral or recorded form” (PHIPA, Section 4).
 The remainder of this chapter uses the term “informed consent” to refer to the requirement
of obtaining permission to use personally identifiable data.

HICs may disclose PHI to a
“prescribed person or entity”
without consent, for purposes of
compiling or maintaining a registry
of PHI intended to facilitate or
improve the provision of health
care, and for the purpose of
analyzing or compiling statistical
information with respect to the
management, evaluation, or
monitoring of the allocation of
resources to, or planning for, all or
part of the health system.
Information compiled by
“prescribed persons and entities” is
permitted to be used for research,
but must follow the same research
rules as HICs in using or disclosing
PHI for research

Deidentification

There are two methods to
deidentify information:
• Under the statistical method, a
statistician or person with
appropriate training verifies
that enough identifiers have
been removed that the risk of
identification of the individual
is very small
• Under the safe harbor method
data is considered deidentified
if the covered entity removes
18 specified personal
identifiers from the data

To “deidentify,” in relation to the
PHI of an individual, means to
remove any information that
identifies the individual or for which
it is reasonably foreseeable in the
circumstances that it could be
utilized, either alone or with other
information, to identify the
individual, and “deidentification”
has a corresponding meaning. HICs
and prescribed persons and entities
must exercise their own judgment in
removing identifiers

and are directly regulated by the Privacy Rule; for others, the Privacy Rule
regulates access to protected health information held by covered entities but
the researchers themselves are not subject to the provisions.
A second major difference is the Privacy Rule and PHIPA’s treatment of deidentified information. Deidentified information is outside the
scope of both rules. However, PHIPA provides a more vague definition of
­“deidentified” than the Privacy Rule, defining it to mean the removal of
“any information that identifies the individual or for which it is reasonably
foreseeable in the circumstances that it could be utilized, either alone or

with other information, to identify the individual.” Because of the lack of
specificity in the definition, and the fact that the Ontario Information and
Privacy Commissioner has not issued any guidance on the deidentification process, HICs are required to exercise judgment in determining when
enough identifiers have been removed that the information is deidentified.
Many HICs take a very conservative approach to the disclosure of personallevel, deidentified information for research and require Research Ethics
Board approval (Canadian equivalent of an IRB or Privacy Board). In
contrast, the Privacy Rule provides two very detailed methods of deidentifying health information: (1) the safe harbor method, and (2) the statistical
method (see Chapter 4). If a covered entity complies with either of these
methods, it may disclose the deidentified information to researchers without
IRB or Privacy Board approval.
A third major difference is that under PHIPA, HICs are permitted to
disclose personal health information without consent to “prescribed persons or entities” that are prescribed by the legislation, including registries
compiled or maintained for purposes of facilitating or improving the provision of health care or that relate to the storage or donation of body parts
or bodily substances. In order to be designated as a prescribed person or
entity, the person or entity must have in place practices, policies, and procedures to protect the privacy of individuals whose personal health information it receives and to maintain the confidentiality of such information.
These practices, policies, and procedures must be reviewed and approved
by Ontario’s Information and Privacy Commissioner (IPC), an individual
appointed by the Ontario Legislature, every 3 years. Prescribed persons and
entities must also make public a description of the functions of the registry
and a summary of its practices, policies, and procedures. Currently, five
registries are designated as a “prescribed person” under PHIPA.10
Once personal health information is held by a prescribed entity, the
entity may use and disclose the information for research purposes in accordance with the normal rules and restrictions on HICs disclosing information for research—including the requirement for approval by a Research
Ethics Board if the information is in identifiable form. There are several
advantages for researchers in obtaining information from prescribed entities, rather than other HICs. Prescribed entities collect personal health
information from a wide range of sources and can link and match the per PHIPA, Section 47(1) (2007).

sonal health information longitudinally. In addition, there is little danger
of selection bias, because informed consent is not required in the collection
of the data. Prescribed entities very rarely need to disclose information in
identifiable form for research, because researchers are given data that is
already aggregated and linked. PHIPA instructs the prescribed entities to
use their judgment in determining if information is deidentified. However,
as noted above, all prescribed entities must have their policies and practices
reviewed by the IPC, including their policies for the deidentification of data.
As a result, prescribed entities are confident in their deidentification process,
and researchers obtaining data from prescribed persons are rarely required
to obtain informed consent or Research Ethics Board approval.
Recently, a similar approach to prescribed entities was recommended
in a report commissioned by the United Kingdom’s Prime Minister on secondary uses of personal information. This report suggested the creation of
“safe harbors,” which have three defining characteristics: (1) they provide
a secure environment for processing personally identifiable health data,
(2) they are restricted to “approved researchers” who meet relevant criteria,
and (3) they implement penalties and allow for criminal sanctions against
researchers who abuse their access to personally identifiable data (Thomas
and Walport, 2008).
The United Kingdom approach is also comparable to PHIPA, because
both models incorporate the concept that personally identifiable information should only be disclosed for health research when the research is beneficial to the public and has scientific merit. PHIPA instructs Research Ethics
Boards to consider both “the public interest in conducting the research and
the public interest in protecting the privacy of the individuals whose PHI
is being disclosed” when reviewing research plans. The United Kingdom
model identifies the principle of proportionality, defined as “an objective
judgment as to whether the benefits outweigh the risks,” as a key consideration when deciding whether personal information may or may not be
shared for health research (Thomas and Walport, 2008). There is also a
precedence for weighing scientific merit in the United States—as previously
noted in Box 4-5, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid’s (CMS’s) Privacy
Boards are instructed to “balance the potential risks to the beneficiary confidentiality with the probable benefits gained from the completed research,”
as well as to consider the researchers’ demonstrated expertise and experience in conducting such a study.
The committee believes an approach similar to PHIPA and the recently
proposed model from the United Kingdom, combined with strong security
measures, offers adequate privacy protections for personally identifiable
health information, while greatly expanding research opportunities. In
particular, the prescribed entity/safe harbor concept offers a useful way
to conduct medical records research and effectively protect patient pri-

vacy and confidentiality by facilitating greater use of deidentified data in
research. Also, PHIPA, the United Kingdom model, and the CMS focus on
only permitting the disclosure of personally identifiable information for
socially beneficial research that has scientific merit ensures that approved
research projects address important health questions and utilizes a scientifically rigorous methodology. In addition, PHIPA’s focus on transparency,
by requiring prescribed persons and entities to post their research purpose,
policies, and procedures, is consistent with desirable comprehensive privacy
protections.
The Committee’s Recommendation
The committee recommends that Congress authorize HHS and other
relevant federal agencies to develop a new approach to ensuring privacy
in health research. When this new approach is implemented, HHS should
exempt health research from the Privacy Rule. The committee suggests
a two-part practical approach to protecting health information privacy
because there are fundamental differences between information-based
research and direct, interventional human subjects research. First, congressional action should be taken to require all interventional research (e.g.,
Phase I–III clinical trials) to comply with the Common Rule, regardless of
funding source. This would eliminate current gaps in oversight and provide protection for all patients who consent to participate in interventional
clinical trials. In addition, all researchers who gain access to personally
identifiable health information as part of the interventional research should
be required to protect that information with strong security measures, as
recommended in Chapter 2. Research participants should be allowed to
provide consent for future research uses of data and biological materials
collected as part of the interventional study, as long as an IRB reviews and
approves the future uses, ensuring that the new study is not incompatible
with the original consent (as recommended in Chapter 4).
Second, Congress should authorize HHS and other relevant federal
agencies to develop a new approach to uniform, goal-oriented oversight
of information-based research, with a focus on best practices in privacy,
security, and transparency as in PHIPA and the proposed United ­Kingdom
model (CIHR, 2005; Thomas and Walport, 2008) and minimizing ­ineffective
and burdensome administrative tasks. This new approach should include
a mechanism by which some programs or institutions could be certified
by HHS or another accrediting body, similar to a prescribed entity as in
PHIPA or a “safe harbor” as in the United Kingdom model. Such certified entities could then collect and analyze personally identifiable health
information for clearly defined and approved purposes, without individual
consent. Because of the administrative requirements in becoming certified,

A NEW FRAMEWORK FOR PROTECTING PRIVACY

265

this option is most appropriate for disease registries and other very large
scale research databases. The regulations should require specific privacy
safeguards for certified entities, including mandatory privacy training for
all staff/researchers; signing of confidentiality agreements; privacy breach
policies and procedures; and mandatory privacy impact assessments. In
addition, the regulations should require certified entities to publicize the
scope and purpose of their data collection (e.g., the types of studies that
may be undertaken with the data). The regulations could also require entities to provide details on what their database will not be used for, to assure
the public that certain types of activities will not be conducted.
Certified entities could also link personally identifiable data from multiple sources (see discussion on linking in Chapter 4) and then provide
aggregated datasets to researchers with direct identifiers removed (see discussion on deidentified data and limited datasets in Chapter 4) (AMS,
2008; Thomas and Walport, 2008). Aggregation would generate more
complete datasets for analysis and thus lead to more meaningful research
results. Data with direct identifiers removed would protect patient privacy
in research and would also streamline research efforts by eliminating the
need to undergo ethics board review, which is not required for research
using deidentified data under the Privacy Rule, PHIPA, or the United Kingdom model. To further protect privacy, unauthorized reidentification of
information that has had direct identifiers removed should be prohibited
by law, and violators should face legal sanctions. In addition, researchers
receiving information with direct identifiers removed should be required to
establish security safeguards and to set limits on access to data.
In cases where researchers cannot use data with direct identifiers
removed, and personally identifiable health information is needed for
research, approval and oversight by an ethics board should be required,
partially analogous to what is now done under the HIPAA Privacy Rule
and PHIPA. This ethics oversight board could perhaps entail a new body
specifically formulated to review medical records research, rather than relying on traditional IRBs that were created to review interventional research.
If researchers seek a waiver of informed consent, an ethics oversight board
should consider the measures the researchers have proposed to take to
protect the privacy, security, and confidentiality of the data, the potential
harms that could result from disclosure of the data, and the potential public
benefits of the proposed research study. Privacy should not automatically
be a more compelling interest than improving health care. However, even
research with little risk to privacy should not be conducted if the study has
little scientific merit or anticipated public benefit.
Under this new system, HHS should implement real consequences for
any researcher or institution that mishandles personally identifiable health
information, regardless of whether it is obtained through informed consent

266

BEYOND THE HIPAA PRIVACY RULE

or under a waiver of informed consent. In order to facilitate consistent
application of this option, HHS should issue clear guidance and best practices (as recommended in Chapter 4) on how to assess the potential harm,
the proposed measures to protect privacy and confidentiality, and the
potential public benefits of a research study, as has been done under PHIPA.
For example, the Canadian Institute for Health Information has developed
best privacy practices for research to provide guidance for determining
whether or not a waiver of consent is warranted (CIHR, 2005).
The primary focus of many IRBs in reviewing research protocols in the
past has been on risks to the physical safety of research participants. There
is a great deal of variability in whether and how IRBs consider the public
benefit and scientific merit of research proposals. But the first rule of ethical research is that the research must have scientific value—meaning that
it addresses an important question of human health and is designed and
conducted using methodology that is appropriate and rigorous. The scientific merit of research varies by project, just as the potential risk to privacy
of research varies across different protocols. The committee believes that
when making decisions about whether a research protocol that entails the
disclosure of personally identifiable information should go forward, ethical oversight boards should take all these factors—potential risks/harms to
research participants’ privacy as well as scientific merit and potential public
benefit of the research proposal—into consideration.
In 2001, a previous IOM committee, the Committee on Assessing
the System for Protecting Human Research Subjects, recommended that
“human research participant protection programs” use distinct mechanisms
for initial, focused reviews of scientific merit and financial conflicts of interest and that these reviews should precede and inform the comprehensive
ethical review of research studies. Ethical oversight board members themselves may not have the expertise to assess the merit of diverse research
studies, but they should have access to evaluations by scientific review committees or funder peer review panels. Input regarding the scientific value of
studies from these experts would help ethical oversight boards assess the
anticipated benefits of a proposed research project.
The Role of Informed Consent in the New Framework
Informed consent is intended to achieve two purposes: (1) protect
research participants from harm and (2) provide respect for the person
(including the person’s privacy, religious beliefs, cultural preferences, and
world views). As outlined above, the framework maintains a requirement
for informed consent for all interventional clinical research. The purpose
of informed consent in this type of research is mainly to protect research
participants from harm by providing a description of the potential risks and

Beyond the HIPAA Privacy Rule: Enhancing Privacy, Improving Health Through Research

A NEW FRAMEWORK FOR PROTECTING PRIVACY

267

benefits of the study and to seek permission to involve the subject. Although
privacy protection is a component of the risk/benefit considerations, the
main focus traditionally has been on physical harms. One study found that
confidentiality is one of the least important considerations for potential
research participants in deciding whether to participate in interventional
clinical research (Tait et al., 2002).
However, it is important to note that interventional researchers are
expected to follow the principles of medical ethics, which require that information disclosed in the course of medical treatment is kept as confidential
as possible. Moreover, the committee’s framework includes the recommendation that strong security safeguards be required for any data collected in
conjunction with an interventional study. The framework’s permission of
future consent for researchers’ use of data and biological materials, actually
increases individuals’ ability to exercise control over their personally identifiable information. Under the Privacy Rule, the requirement to obtain a new
authorization form signed for each research study means that most future
studies actually proceed under a waiver of authorization, and individuals
are deprived of all input into future uses of their information (Nosowsky
and Giordano, 2006). Thus, informed consent in this context addresses
protection from both physical harm and dignitary harm.
In contrast, in information-based research that relies solely on medical
records and stored biospecimens, the research participant faces no risk of
physical harm. In this context, informed consent is intended to ensure that
individuals are able to exercise control over their personally identifiable
health information that is held by third parties, and to give individuals the
right to determine whether their personally identifiable health information
can be used in a particular research project (or a series of such projects,
if consent for future research is permitted). However, a universal requirement for informed consent can lead to invalid results, because of significant
differences between patients who do or do not grant consent, and missed
opportunities to advance medical science because it can be prohibitively
costly and difficult to obtain consent for studies that require analysis of
very large datasets.
As a result, the framework includes two alternatives to requiring
informed consent that can be used in certain circumstances (i.e., disclosure
to a certified entity and waiver of informed consent by an ethics oversight
board), which are intended to facilitate research that is in the public interest. For research that makes use of these two alternatives, the framework
counterbalances the absence of informed consent with an increase in security, transparency, and accountability protections by: (1) requiring certified
entities to protect the privacy and confidentiality of personally identifiable
health information records in a manner that is approved by an outside party
(HHS or a different body), (2) requiring certified entities to fully disclose

268

BEYOND THE HIPAA PRIVACY RULE

what research is being conducted with its data, (3) requiring ethics oversight
review for research that uses personally identifiable data under a waiver of
informed consent, (4) implementing clear and consistent consequences for
researchers who are responsible for privacy or security breaches, and (5)
encouraging the development and use of improved security protections for
use in health research.
Public opinion polls indicate that a significant portion of the public
would prefer to control all access to their medical records via informed
consent. However, as noted above, a universal requirement for informed
consent would impede important health research and lead to biased,
ungeneralizable results, to the detriment of society. The committee believes
that the new framework provides strong protections for data privacy and
security, beyond that currently provided under the Privacy Rule, while
increasing the opportunities for important health research by offering an
alternative to informed consent under certain circumstances.
The Belmont Report, one of the most influential reports on the advancement of human research participant protections, recognizes that principles of
respect for persons and autonomy are not absolutes and must be considered
along with other ethical principles. It acknowledges that there may be compelling reasons to limit autonomy, providing that “To show lack of respect
for an autonomous agent is to repudiate that person’s considered judgments,
to deny an individual the freedom to act on those considered judgments, or
to withhold information necessary to make a considered judgment, when
there are no compelling reasons to do so” (emphasis added) (Hew, 1979).
Similarly, a 1994 IOM report argued that existing health information, stored
in medical records and biospecimen banks, should be released to researchers without informed consent if such studies were regarded as being in the
public’s interest (IOM, 1994).
If society seeks to derive the benefits of medical research in the form of
improved health and health care, information should be shared to achieve
that societal benefit (Chadwick and Berg, 2001; Knoppers and Chadwick,
2005; Liu, 2007), and governing regulations should support the use of
such information. Recent reports from the United Kingdom have come to a
similar conclusion and recommend that the law allow the use of personally
identifiable health information without consent if the use of that information is necessary and the potential benefits to society outweigh the individual
risks (AMS, 2006, 2008; Thomas and Walport, 2008). In the committee’s
proposed new framework, the greater emphasis on ensuring the security protections of personally identifiable health information, facilitating research
using data with direct identifiers removed, and ensuring the scientific merits
of any proposed research should help to foster its acceptability. Nonetheless,
to implement this new framework, effective communication with the public

A NEW FRAMEWORK FOR PROTECTING PRIVACY

269

regarding the value of this model will be important to address concerns and
gain acceptance, as recommended in Chapter 3.
The New Framework Addresses
the Overarching GOALS
The committee supports its argument in favor of implementing a new
framework for protecting privacy in health research by outlining how this
approach achieves the committee’s three overarching goals: (1) improving
the privacy and data security of health information, (2) improving the
effectiveness of health research, and (3) improving the application of privacy protections for health research (see Box 6-1). The committee believes
many of the limitations of the current federal regulation of research can be
improved or solved by the proposed framework.
Improving the Privacy and Data Security of Health Information
The new framework includes a number of mechanisms to improve the
protection of research participants’ privacy and security in health research.
First, the privacy of research participants is improved because the new
framework applies to all institutions and all health researchers who collect, use, and disclose personally identifiable health information. Similar to
Ontario’s PHIPA, this means that the privacy protections follow the data.
No matter what entity or individual holds the personally identifiable data,
the same set of privacy safeguards are required.
Second, the new framework maintains the requirement that ­researchers
obtain informed consent for all interventional clinical research and
­strengthens the security protections of data collected in the course of a
clinical trial. The new framework also permits research participants in
interventional, clinical research to provide informed consent for future
research uses of their data and biological materials collected as part of the
study. The privacy of these individuals is protected by requiring an IRB
to review any future studies and to determine that the future uses are not
incompatible with the original informed consent. This aspect of the new
framework actually promotes individuals’ ability to exercise control over
their personally identifiable information. As stated above, the requirement
in the Privacy Rule that researchers must obtain new authorization for
every use of protected health information means that most future studies
proceed under a waiver of authorization, and individuals are deprived of
all input into future uses of their information (Nosowsky and Giordano,
2006).
Third, the new framework protects privacy by maintaining the default
requirement that researchers must obtain informed consent to use person-

270

BEYOND THE HIPAA PRIVACY RULE

ally identifiable data for research. If researchers wish to use personally
identifiable data without obtaining informed consent for information-based
research, they are required to identify and document their research objectives to an ethics oversight board, and they must identify the measures by
which they will protect the privacy, security, and confidentiality of the data.
The ethics oversight boards provide impartial review, and are only permitted to waive informed consent after considering the measures to protect
the privacy, security, and confidentiality of the data; the risk of harm in
conducting the research; and the potential public benefit of the research
study.
Fourth, the new framework protects privacy by creating certified entities
that facilitate researchers use of data with direct identifiers removed. One of
the major problems with the deidentification provisions of the Privacy Rule
is the difficulty in linking data from multiple sources to generate more complete datasets or to follow patient outcomes longitudinally (see Chapter 5
for more details). The new framework’s certified entity concept provides a
solution to this problem; certified entities are able to link and match personally identifiable information longitudinally from multiple sources and can
then disclose data with direct identifiers removed to researchers. Because
the data provided by certified entities with direct identifiers removed has
already been linked and aggregated, it is more useful for research. Thus,
researchers will be able to make greater use of deidentified datasets and
will need access to personally identifiable data in fewer situations. Privacy
is improved because there are fewer risks to privacy when researchers do
not access or use personally identifiable data.
In addition, the privacy of data held by certified entities is protected
because certified entities are required to have their privacy and security
policies approved and re-approved on a regular basis by an outside party
(HHS or a different body). Certified entities are also required to implement
specific privacy safeguards including mandatory privacy training for all
staff/researchers, signing of confidentiality agreements, privacy breach policies and procedures, mandatory privacy impact assessments, and security
safeguards and limits on access to data.
Finally, the new framework protects privacy in health research by
requiring the implementation of comprehensive privacy protections, including transparency, accountability, and security. Transparency is improved by
the new framework’s requirement that certified entities publicize the scope
and purpose of their data collection and provide information on what
uses of their data will not be permitted. Transparency is also achieved by
requiring researchers to describe in detail their research plans and objectives (either to potential research participants or to the ethics oversight
board) and to justify the data they wish to use and/or collect. Accountability is improved by the new framework because it requires Congress
and HHS to implement clear and consistent consequences for researchers

A NEW FRAMEWORK FOR PROTECTING PRIVACY

271

who are responsible for privacy or security breaches. The new framework
also includes provisions for penalizing any individuals who attempt to reidentify data that has had its direct identifiers removed. Security is improved
in the new framework because all holders of health data, both personally
identifiable data and data with direct identifiers removed, are required to
implement security safeguards, as described in Chapter 2, and to set limits
on access to data. The committee also believes that the increased emphasis
on accountability in the new framework will encourage researchers and
other stakeholders to invest money in developing privacy-enhancing technologies for use in research, to reduce the risk of accidental breaches and
the associated consequences.
Improving the Effectiveness of Health Research
The new framework is intended to provide a method of regulating health
research, including the protection of individual privacy, in a way that minimizes impediments to beneficial research. First, allowing patients to consent
to the future use of specimens collected during the course of an interventional
study or treatment will reduce many barriers to researchers’ use of existing
biospecimen banks. Patient privacy is protected by requiring any future
uses of these specimens to be approved by an IRB, which should determine
whether a proposed study has scientific merit, implements appropriate privacy protections, and is not incompatible with the original consent.
Second, the creation of certified entities that can receive personally
identifiable health information for information-based research without
patient informed consent, similar to PHIPA’s prescribed entities and the
United Kingdom’s safe harbors (Thomas and Walport, 2008), will result
in more complete and representative datasets, and thus will result in more
generalizable results. The creation of certified entities will also facilitate
research using data with direct identifiers removed. As stated above, under
the current system, researchers cannot link datasets from multiple covered
entities without a unique identifier. If a certified entity performed this task,
researchers could make greater use of data without identifiers.
Third, the goal-oriented framework with a focus on best practices
should aid the work of both researchers and IRBs and reduce the variability
across different institutions. For example, it should be easier for IRBs to
make appropriate decisions regarding waivers of informed consent because
the framework’s goal is to allow beneficial research to be conducted if comprehensive privacy and security safeguards are in place and privacy risks
are minimized. Identification and dissemination of best practices in privacy
protection for various types of health research would help delineate what
IRBs should do to facilitate responsible research, rather than just defining
what is permissible.

272

BEYOND THE HIPAA PRIVACY RULE

Finally, the committee believes this framework will reduce some of
the research costs and time that have increased since the Privacy Rule was
implemented because the framework is designed to make research oversight
more uniform and to reduce administrative burdens.
Improving the Application of Privacy Protections for Health Research
A recent report by the National Committee on Vital and Health
S­ tatistics (NCVHS) recognized the importance of having nationally uniform privacy protections for all secondary uses of health data, including
research. The report criticized the Privacy Rule’s reliance on the covered entity construct and creation of business associate agreements to
PHI (NCVHS, 2007). The framework proposed by the IOM committee
addresses this criticism of the Privacy Rule, and provides for a comprehensive regulation of research that applies to all researchers and protects
all personally identifiable health data in research. It eliminates a primary
problem of harmonization of privacy protections because the framework
is intended to be the only regulation governing researchers’ use of health
data. In addition, the implementation of this framework would improve
the clarity of privacy protections because currently much of the confusion
is due to the Privacy Rule’s complicated interactions with other existing
privacy regulations, such as the Common Rule.
One potential challenge under the new framework is the need to define
health research and to distinguish interventional research from informationbased research. HHS will need to develop clear guidelines to help researchers and ethics oversight boards consistently make this distinction. The
identification and dissemination by HHS of best practices in research protections (as recommended in Chapter 5) will be important to ensure greater
uniformity of goal-oriented research oversight and to ensure that the framework is implemented in a way that facilitates research without undermining
individual privacy. In addition, there will be some administrative burden in
certifying and overseeing the certified entities.
Relevance of the Recommendation
to Other Federal Actions
The committee’s recommendation for a new framework to regulate
health research is particularly timely because new actions at the federal
level are being considered or have already been taken to protect the privacy of electronic health records. These developments raise new concerns
about potential impacts on health research. The committee believes this
proposal will stimulate fresh ideas about the best ways to protect privacy

A NEW FRAMEWORK FOR PROTECTING PRIVACY

273

and improve research as the nation addresses these two interrelated values
over the next several years.
An example of one of the recent developments affecting research is the
Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA’s) August 2007 directive. Outlining
new conditions under which it would release data from VA hospitals to
state central cancer registries, the directive requires states to sign a data
use agreement with the VA and to agree to implement privacy and security
protections above and beyond the protections required in the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules. Among other requirements, state registries must
agree not to release VA cancer data to persons outside the registry or to
reuse the data for any purpose other than for maintaining cancer statistics
(Kolata, 2007b).
Each state has a law establishing cancer surveillance programs that collect information on every patient who is diagnosed with cancer in that state.
Also, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) collects cancer statistics from 17
U.S. regions in order to track national cancer rates. Prior to the VA directive, the state cancer surveillance programs and the NCI included information gathered from VA hospitals. However, as of October 10, 2007, only a
small percentage of the states had signed the VA directive, and most cancer
surveillance programs were missing data on veterans (Kolata, 2007a).
In addition, the VA directive stipulates that researchers who want to use
cancer statistics from VA hospitals must either obtain permission from the VA
Under Secretary of Health or collaborate with a VA researcher on the project.
Health researchers are finding it hard to conduct cancer research under these
conditions, which makes it difficult to find VA researchers willing to collaborate on specific projects. The directive also complicates the IRB approval
process, often requiring researchers to obtain approval from their local IRB,
the cancer registry IRB, and the VA Under Secretary (Kolata, 2007b). In
addition, cancer researchers who either cannot meet the VA requirements
or choose not to go through the additional procedural requirements, and do
not include VA data in their study, risk having their results compromised by
selection bias (see Chapter 5, section on Selection Bias).
Several recently proposed bills that address the use of electronic medical records also contain language regarding health privacy and health
research (Table 6-2).
In 2004, President Bush issued an executive order calling for the widespread adoption of an interoperable electronic health record system within
10 years, arguing that health information technology (HIT) is a means of
addressing rising health care costs and improving the quality and efficiency
of health care (Bush, 2004). In response, HHS has awarded a number of
HIT grants to gather information on privacy and security issues in HIT,
solicited recommendations from NCVHS, and created the American Health

A NEW FRAMEWORK FOR PROTECTING PRIVACY

Information Community to provide policy advice (AHIC, 2006; GAO,
2007; NCVHS, 2006).
But privacy concerns are emerging as a primary obstacle to implementing a nationwide HIT system, with many privacy and consumer groups
pushing for tighter privacy protections than offered under the Privacy Rule.
In a 2006 poll, 62 percent of respondents stated that the use of electronic
health records would pose new risks to privacy, and 42 percent answered
that the privacy risks of HIT outweigh expected benefits (Harris Interactive,
2007). Another poll found that 80 percent of Americans say they are very
concerned about identity theft or fraud in an HIT system (Markle Foundation, 2006). The Government Accountability Office recently released
a report that legitimized these concerns and criticized HHS for failing to
define an overall approach for protecting privacy in a nationwide HIT
system (GAO, 2007).
To address the privacy concerns, Congress has proposed a number of
bills intended to advance the implementation of an HIT system and at the
same time protect individual privacy11 (see Table 6-2). Several of these bills
include new restrictions and rules governing researchers’ access to personally identifiable health information. It is unclear whether any of these bills
will pass or what requirements a final law might include. However, because
a nationwide HIT system has the potential to facilitate health research by
making large amounts of health data available to study, and thus could
lead to major advances in medicine, caution is warranted. Adoption of
new, restrictive regulations might impede health research, to the detriment
of patients and society. Therefore, a closer examination of some concepts
that have been incorporated into these proposed bills, including autonomy
and informed consent, is warranted. At the same time, it is clear there is
a need to develop privacy safeguards that anticipate the risk of extensive
electronic recordkeeping, as well as the growing problems of identity theft
and security breaches.
ConclusionS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The primary justification for including research provisions in the
HIPAA Privacy Rule was to remedy perceived shortcomings of federal
privacy protections in health research under the Common Rule. But the
Privacy Rule has numerous limitations of its own. In proposing the Privacy
Rule, HHS acknowledged that, ideally, it would have preferred to regulate
health researchers directly by extending the protections of the Common
11 A number of bills from the 110th Congress also address the implementation of HIT, but
do not include comprehensive privacy or research provisions, including HR 1368, S 1408,
and S 1455.

BEYOND THE HIPAA PRIVACY RULE

Rule to research that is not federally supported and by imposing additional
criteria for the waiver of patient informed consent for the use of personally identifiable health information in research.12 But HHS recognized it
did not have the authority to do this. For that reason, HHS attempted to
protect the health information released to researchers indirectly (but within
the scope of its limited authority) by imposing restrictions on information
disclosures by covered entities. NCVHS and others have noted the limitations of the Privacy Rule and have called for stronger protections of health
privacy—notably, by expanding the purview of the Privacy Rule beyond
the current covered entities.
However, the IOM committee believes an even bolder change is needed.
The number of studies using medical records to address important questions about health and disease will likely increase with the growing availability of electronic health records. As the volume and importance of
digital personally identifiable health data increase exponentially, the public
can be expected to heighten demands for a legal framework that provides
meaningful safeguards to protect health information in the health research
setting. Thus, the IOM committee recommends that Congress authorize
HHS and other relevant federal agencies to develop a new framework for
ensuring privacy that would apply uniformly to all health research and
that will both protect individuals’ privacy and facilitate responsible and
beneficial health research.
When this new approach is implemented, HHS should exempt health
research from the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The new approach would enhance
privacy protections through improved data privacy and security, increased
transparency of activities and policies, and greater accountability. The new
approach should do all the following:
•
•
•
•

Apply to any person, institution, or organization conducting health
research in the United States, regardless of the source of data or
funding.
Entail clear, goal-oriented, rather than prescriptive, regulations.
Require researchers, institutions, and organizations that store
health data to establish strong data security safeguards.
Make a clear distinction between the privacy considerations that
apply to interventional research and research that is exclusively
information based.

Resources (1997), and Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information:

A NEW FRAMEWORK FOR PROTECTING PRIVACY

281

Facilitate greater use of data with direct identifiers removed
in health research, and implement legal sanctions to prohibit
­unauthorized reidentification of information that has had direct
identifiers removed.
Require ethical oversight of research when personally identifiable
health information is used without informed consent. HHS should
develop best practices for oversight that should consider:
— Measures taken to protect the privacy, security, and confidentiality of the data;
— Potential harms that could result from disclosure of the data;
and
— Potential public benefits of the research.
Certify institutions that have policies and practices in place to protect data privacy and security in order to facilitate important largescale information-based research for clearly defined and approved
purposes, without individual consent.
Include federal oversight and enforcement to ensure regulatory
compliance.

A new approach to protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information used in health research that emphasizes privacy, security, ­ accountability, and transparency and that is applicable to all health
research in the United States would eliminate the research community’s
confusion, reduce institutional variability in research privacy practices,
facilitate responsible research, and enhance the public’s trust in the research
enterprise. Clear and simple regulations that are less subject to varying
interpretation by ethical oversight boards, as well as federal oversight and
enforcement of regulatory compliance, will be important to consistently
and efficiently ensure privacy and instill trust while enabling important
research.
The new framework developed by HHS and other relevant federal
agencies should provide strong and effective protection for often-sensitive
personally identifiable health information and facilitate scientific discovery
and medical innovation necessary to save lives and enhance the quality of
the public’s health. And it should do so in a way that does not burden individuals with a flurry of health privacy notices and consent forms, or burden
our health care system with a new level of bureaucracy and expense.

Appendix A
Previous Recommendations
to the Department of Health
and Human Services

As a result of the reported concerns about the Privacy Rule’s effect on
health research, several organizations have provided the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services (HHS) with recommendations on how to
improve the way the Privacy Rule regulates research. Table A-1 describes
the recommendations of the National Committee on Vital and Health
Statistics, the Association of American Medical Colleges, the Secretary’s
Advisory Committee on Human Research Protections, and the National
Cancer Advisory Board. A brief explanation of how these organizations
generated their recommendations is provided below.
National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics
The U.S. Congress gave the National Committee on Vital and Health
Statistics (NCVHS) the responsibility of advising the Secretary of HHS on
the adoption of the Privacy Rule standards, monitoring its implementation,
and reporting annually to Congress on the progress made in its adoption.
In accordance with this mandate, NCVHS has held a number of hearings
on the Privacy Rule and the problems that the medical community has
experienced in implementing the requirements of the Privacy Rule. One of
the topics explored during these hearings was the obstacles associated with
conducting research under the Privacy Rule. After each hearing, NCVHS
subsequently issued a letter to the Secretary of HHS with a set of recommendations for improving the Privacy Rule. The recommendations outlined
in Table A-1 are based on the hearings held on August 21–23, 2001, and
November 19–20, 2003 (NCVHS, 2001, 2004).

Issues

Creates excessive paperwork for
covered entities and has resulted in
some covered entities refusing to
make PHI available to researchers.

Loss of ability to carry out research
because of loss of information,
cost, and administrative burden.

1. Institutional Review Boards
(IRBs) already consider recruitment
as part of their study oversight.
2. Artificial distinction between
internal and external researchers
exists.
3. Identification and contacting
potential research participants are
considered different activities.
4. Creation of biased populations
in studies, especially too few lesseducated, low-income individuals.

Topic

Accounting for disclosures of
protected health information
(PHI) for research purposes

Standards for deidentification of
data

Recruitment of research subjects

2. If “1” is rejected, HHS should provide additional
formal guidance on contacting potential research
participants
and
HHS should end differential treatment of internal and
external researchers for purposes of identifying and
contacting potential participants (SACHRP, NCVHS).

1. HHS should classify research recruitment as a
health care operation, obviating the need for
authorization and allaying confusion (SACHRP).

HHS should review standards to reduce the number
of categories removed from deidentified data.

2. HHS should issue guidance to provide covered
entities with ways to fulfill this requirement in a
convenient and practical manner (NCVHS).

1. Eliminate the accounting for disclosures
requirement for research (AAMC, SACHRP)
and
instead, inform patients that PHI might be used for
research purposes (SACHRP).

Discrepancies between the
Common Rule and the Privacy
Rule create challenges for IRBs and
Privacy Boards that must make
decisions about such things as
waivers of authorization.

Loss of future research
opportunities; confusion regarding
combined authorization.

2. HHS should provide further interpretation,
guidance, and technical assistance to help the research
community to understand the relationship between
the Privacy Rule and the Common Rule (NCVHS).

1. Revise categories of research not requiring
authorization to include research determined by IRB
to be exempt from Common Rule requirements
(SACHRP).

3. Clarify how identified datasets collected under a
broad authorization to create a database could be
released to researchers through the use of a waiver of
authorization, a limited dataset, or by deidentifying
the information.

2. Eliminate the restriction on the use of data for
unspecified future research, or allow a less specific
description of the intended use (NCAB).

1. When an IRB has approved a consent form that
permits future uses under the Common Rule
standard, the same should apply under the Privacy
Rule. Permit combining research authorization for a
clinical trial and for banking data and materials
collected as part of the trial in a single form
(NCVHS, SACHRP).

Issues

The process for obtaining an
authorization or waiver of
authorization is burdensome, and
discourages research from being
conducted.

Authorization and informed
consent can be combined into a
single document. Under the
Common Rule, IRBs must review
informed consent documents.
However, the Privacy Rule does not
require IRBs to review
authorization forms.

It is unclear whether DNA samples
can ever be deidentified because
analyzing the samples could reveal
unique DNA identifiers of the
individual.

Academic medical centers cannot
organize in a manner that reflects
the functional operations of the
medical school, affiliated practice
plans, and teaching hospital.

Topic

Use and disclosure of PHI for
research

IRB waiver of authorization

Genetics research

Types of covered entities

TABLE A-1 Continued

The covered entity status, hybrid entity status, and
affiliated covered entity status should be redefined to
reflect the function served by the different parts of the
organization, not the organizational form of the
organization.

HHS should clarify whether DNA samples can be
considered deidentified data.

HHS should clarify that nothing in the Privacy Rule
prevents IRBs from reviewing authorization forms
when considering the adequacy of privacy and
confidentiality of subjects under the Common Rule.

2. Continue to require authorization or waiver of
authorization for research, despite the administrative
burden (NCVHS).

1. Authorization and waiver of authorization
requirements should be eliminated for research
purposes. Research disclosures are adequately
protected by the Common Rule (AAMC).

2. More generally, clarify what the rules are regarding
research on foreign nationals.

1. Clarify, if legally possible, that PHI from foreign
nationals outside the United States collected by
researchers from covered entities is not subject to the
Privacy Rule solely because of the relationship with
the covered entity.

BEYOND THE HIPAA PRIVACY RULE

Association of American Medical Colleges
The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) has publicly
opposed the current research provisions of the Privacy Rule since the Final
Rule was proposed in 2002. During the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
period, AAMC submitted a lengthy and detailed comment urging HHS not
to apply the Privacy Rule to research. AAMC has continued to campaign
for a change in the rule’s regulation of research since it became law. In
spring 2003, AAMC conducted a survey of 331 investigators, Institutional
Review Board personnel, privacy officials, research administrators, deans,
and others involved in research to gain knowledge about how the Privacy
Rule has influenced the research process. AAMC then created a database of
qualitative case reports documenting research projects that were affected,
delayed, hindered, benefited, abandoned, or foregone because of the Privacy
Rule (see also Chapter 5 for survey results). Based on the results of the
survey, AAMC came up with a number of recommendations for improving
the Privacy Rule’s regulation of research (NCVHS, 2003).
Secretary’s Advisory Committee on
Human Research Protections
The Secretary’s Advisory Committee on Human Research Protections
(SACHRP) is charged with advising the Secretary of HHS on human subjects research and the protection of human subjects. On March 30, 2004,
SACHRP received presentations from a number of different medical experts
on the Privacy Rule’s impact on human subjects research. Based on these
presentations, SACHRP submitted recommendations to HHS on September 1, 2004, on areas of the Privacy Rule that it deemed in need of clarification or modification (SACHRP, 2005).
National Cancer Advisory Board
The National Cancer Advisory Board (NCAB) is appointed by the
President to advise the Secretary of HHS and the Director of the National
Cancer Institute with respect to the activities of the Institute. In 2003,
NCAB undertook a survey to examine the impact that the Privacy Rule
has had on cancer research. It requested the names of Privacy Rule experts
from cancer center directors, Clinical Cooperative Group Chairs, and principal investigators of Special Programs of Research Excellence. Through
this process 226 Privacy Rule experts were identified. These experts were
invited to visit a Website and submit public comments on the effect of the
Privacy Rule on cancer research. A total of 89 responses were received (see
also Chapter 5 for survey results). On November 5, 2004, NCAB sent a

Appendix B
Commissioned Survey Methodology

A review of the literature demonstrated a dearth of systematic data to
determine what impact the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule was having on health research. As a result, the
Institute of Medicine (IOM) committee sought larger surveys with national
coverage. In consultation with committee members, the IOM took the
unusual step of commissioning several surveys to assess current perceptions among health researchers of the effect of the Privacy Rule on research
and to measure the public’s perception of and expectations for privacy in
health research.
The first survey entailed a national web-based survey of U.S. epidemiologists, overseen by Dr. Roberta Ness at the University of Pittsburgh. A second project, undertaken by Sarah Greene and Dr. Ed Wagner at the Group
Health Center for Health Studies in Seattle, involved a survey of HMO
Research Network (HMORN) investigators and a survey of HMORN
Institutional Review Boards (IRBs). The third survey was a Harris Interactive Poll of the public, developed by Alan Westin of the Privacy Consulting
Group. The methods used in conducting these surveys are described below.
The results are described in Chapters 2 and 5 of this report and are reported
in more detail in Ness (2007), Westin (2007), and Greene et al. (2008).

 The surveys were commissioned with private funding. No federal funds were used to sup-

port collection of survey data.

BEYOND THE HIPAA PRIVACY RULE

NATIONAL Survey of U.S. Epidemiologists
Participants
Epidemiologists were surveyed because they are an identifiable professional group of scientists engaged in human subjects research, and their
research often involves the use of medical records. Support was enlisted
from all professional groups that were known to represent U.S. epidemiologists employed in academia, industry, government, and nongovernment
organizations. These included the American Academy of Pediatrics, Section
on Epidemiology; American ­College of Epidemiology; American College of
Preventive Medicine; American Diabetes ­Association, Council on Epidemiology & Statistics; American Public Health Association, Epidemiology Section; International Genetic Epidemiology Society; International Society for
Environmental Epidemiology; International Society for Pharmacoepidemiology; Society for Clinical ­Trials; Society for Epidemiologic Research; Society
for Healthcare Epidemiology; ­Society for Pediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology; and Society for the Analysis of ­African-American Public Health Issues.
Of 14 societies approached, the 13 listed above participated.
Each society e-mailed all its active members and requested that they
respond to a web-based survey on the Privacy Rule. E-mail lists are updated
annually for dues collection. Identical e-mails requesting participation in
the survey were sent to the membership of each society three times, once
a month during a 3-month period (January–April 2007). In an effort to
avoid response duplication—because a substantial number of epidemiologists belong to more than one organization—respondents were asked, both
in the cover e-mail and in the introduction to the survey, to respond only
once. Individual responses were submitted anonymously over the Internet
so that they could not be linked to any individual. IRB approval as an
exempt protocol was obtained at the University of Pittsburgh and reviewed
and approved by the National Academies’ IRB.
The 13 participating epidemiology societies sent e-mails to a total of
10,347 individual addresses. A cover e-mail asked professionals who are
engaged in the conduct of U.S.-based human subjects research and who
recognized the term Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act or
HIPAA to respond. A total of 2,805 individuals accessed the Website, and
2,376 individuals answered a screening question that asked, “Since HIPAA
was implemented in April 2003, how many new applications involving
human subjects have you submitted to a U.S. IRB?” Respondents answering zero were thanked for their time, and no further questions were asked.
The 1,527 respondents who provided a response of one or more are the
participants in these analyses.

APPENDIX B

Survey Content
The survey questionnaire was developed by Roberta Ness with input
and review by the IOM committee. Questions were asked about both positive and negative potential influences of the HIPAA Privacy Rule, including
the influence of the Privacy Rule on participant privacy, confidentiality, and
public trust, as well as on research procedures. Four general approaches
were used to ascertain information. First, questions with quantitative
response categories were asked. These questions addressed issues such as
the frequency of various types of data collection undertaken by respondents;
changes in participant recruitment before and after the implementation of
the Privacy Rule; frequency of IRB modifications secondary to Privacy Rule
provisions and their effect; level of difficulty in obtaining deidentified data
and waivers; familiarity with covered entities’ opting out of research because
of the Privacy Rule; studies conceived but not submitted to IRBs because of
Privacy Rule concerns; and perceived effect of the Privacy Rule on patient
confidentiality. Survey respondents were also asked about their gender, training, employment, and sources of funding.
Second, researchers were asked for their perceptions rated on a 5-point
Likert scale about issues such as the ease and difficulty of conducting
research under the Privacy Rule and the effect the Privacy Rule has had on
participant privacy/confidentiality. Third, respondents were asked whether
and under what circumstances their IRB would approve each of five case
studies. These involved retrieval of historical identified medical records;
access to identified participants in a hospital-based cancer registry; access to
deidentified data in a hospital-based tissue bank; review of medical records
of deceased individuals; and request for a limited dataset (defined by the
Privacy Rule) from a nonaffiliated hospital. Finally, respondents were asked
open-ended qualitative questions, including a final request: “Please tell us
your stories about HIPAA. These will help us to understand all of the circumstances in which HIPAA has affected your research.”
After development of a draft instrument, survey content was vetted
and modified by members of the IOM committee. In a pilot phase, questions were distributed to 10 epidemiologists at the University of Pittsburgh.
After completing the survey, the respondents were debriefed to identify
ambiguities, streamline the instrument, and determine how readily a typical
epidemiologist could answer questions. After the instrument was finalized,
timed pilot tests took 10 to 15 minutes to complete.
Statistical Analysis
Simple descriptive statistics, retaining each distinctive response category, were used to analyze these data. The 5-point Likert scales that were

anchored by “none” and “a great deal” were collapsed into 1 to 2, 3, and
4 to 5. Categories were reported rather than central tendencies in order to
retain the full and unedited character of the data. Only univariate analyses
were reported because the focus was on a description of the self-reported
impact of the Privacy Rule, rather than predictors of responses.
Harris Interactive Poll of the Public
Successive drafts of the survey questionnaire were prepared by Alan
Westin, with input and review by the IOM committee members. The final
version was then reviewed and edited by David Krane, vice president,
Harris Interactive. The survey was conducted online by Harris Interactive
between September 11 and 18, 2007, with 2,392 respondents. Both closed
and open-ended questions were used. The results were adjusted by Harris
to represent the total adult U.S. population in 2007, estimated at 225 million persons, not just those who go online. Figures for age, gender, race/
ethnicity, education, region, and household income were weighted where
necessary to bring them in line with their actual proportions in the population. Propensity score weighting was also used to adjust for respondents’
propensity to using the Internet.
Respondents for this survey were selected from among those who have
agreed to participate in Harris Interactive surveys. Because the sample is
based on those who agreed to participate in the Harris Interactive panel,
no estimates of theoretical sampling error can be calculated. According to
Harris Interactive, all sample surveys and polls, whether or not they use
probability sampling, are subject to multiple sources of error. These errors
are most often not possible to quantify or estimate, including sampling
error, coverage error, error associated with nonresponse, error associated
with question wording and response options, and postsurvey weighting
and adjustments. Therefore, Harris Interactive avoids the term “margin
of error” because it is misleading. All that can be calculated are different
possible sampling errors with different probabilities for pure, unweighted,
random samples with 100 percent response rates. These are only theoretical
because no published polls come close to this ideal.
For analytic purposes, standard demographics for cross-tabulations
were collected for region, age, generation, gender, race, party affiliation,
education, income, marital status, children in the household, sexual orientation, disabilities, political philosophy, and employment. In addition, a
set of custom health demographics was created from respondents’ answers
to questions about their overall health status, whether they have been care­
givers, whether they have or have had six specified types of health conditions, and whether they have had a genetic test.
Generally, a group with a 5 percent or higher variation from the total

public’s response, from one of our demographic, health-aspect, or attitudinal subsets, was reported as a significant demographic variation. When the
­public total is 18 percent or less, 3 or 4 percent higher variation was used.
Survey of HMORN Researchers and IRB Administrators
Researcher Survey
A Web-based survey was used to collect data about researchers’ experience with the HIPAA Privacy Rule (e.g., how their research protocols
may have been affected by HIPAA, knowledge of and attitudes toward the
HIPAA Privacy Rule regulations, and limited demographic information).
To be eligible, participants had to be members of the scientific faculty
(i.e., assistant, associate, or full investigator level, or the equivalent ranking system, plus research associates or staff scientists) at one of the HMO
Research Network sites listed below:
1. Geisinger Health System, Center for Health Research and Rural
Advocacy
2. Group Health Center for Health Studies
3. Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, Department of Ambulatory Care &
Prevention
4. HealthPartners Research Foundation
5. Henry Ford Health System, Center for Health Services Research &
the Research Epidemiology Programs in cancer and biostatistics
6. Kaiser Permanente Colorado, Clinical Research Unit
7. Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Division of Research
8. Kaiser Permanente Northwest, The Center for Health Research
(includes investigators from Kaiser Permanente Georgia & Kaiser
Permanente Hawaii)
9. Kaiser Permanente Southern California, Department of Research
and Evaluation
10. Lovelace Clinic Research Foundation, Health Services Research
Division
11. Marshfield Clinic Research Foundation, Epidemiology Research
Center
12. Meyers Primary Care Institute
13. Scott & White Health System, Research and Education Department
Successive drafts of the survey questionnaire were prepared by Sarah
Greene, with input and review by the IOM committee. An invitation email was sent to all faculty members with a link to a web-based survey.
Each respondent received a unique website address ­taking him/her to the

survey, and once a respondent completed the survey the website address
could not be reused. The recipients also received two e-mail reminders to
complete the web-based survey. A total of 235 investigators were invited
to complete the web-based survey. Of those, 26 of the e-mail invitations
bounced back, and 2 individuals actively refused to complete the survey.
A total of 89 individuals completed the survey, and the remaining 118
individuals never responded to the invitations. The information obtained
from the investigators included:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

The degree to which a study protocol was affected by the HIPAA
Privacy Rule;
Characteristics of the affected study;
Attitudes toward the HIPAA Privacy Rule provisions;
Specific structures or personnel created at their site to address
HIPAA;
Studies considered, but not implemented due to real/perceived
HIPAA-related concerns;
Open-ended “comments” fields to allow researchers to elaborate
on their responses;
Select demographic items including number of years in research;
HMORN site membership; and
Request to contact researcher for follow-up interview if web survey
answers warrant it.

Nineteen respondents who reported a HIPAA-affected study in the web
survey indicated a willingness to participate in a follow-up interview. These
subjects were contacted via e-mail to initiate an appointment for a telephone interview at a mutually convenient time. Three individuals opted out
when they were contacted about scheduling the interview, and two could
not be reached after 4 weeks of both e-mail and phone attempts. Twelve
interviews were completed.
The interviews were semi-structured to ensure systematic collection
of key study details, but also to allow each individual to describe his/her
unique experience about conducting research under the HIPAA Privacy
Rule. At least two members of the study team were present for each interview to assist with note taking and capturing all relevant information.
The principal investigator then reviewed the qualitative data for common
themes and unique issues. Each response was rated as positive, negative, or
neutral. The information obtained from these investigators included:
•

A general description of the study (e.g., purpose, design, protocol,
data sources, intervention)

•
•
•
•

What types of changes were made to the study as a result of the
HIPAA regulations
Whether these changes had a negative impact on the study design
or time line
For multisite studies, whether differences arose across sites, and the
nature of those differences
Perceptions about their site’s interpretations of HIPAA

For the web survey, descriptive characteristics were reported as means,
medians, or frequencies. Frequencies were generated for categorical variables, and chi square tests were used to analyze continuous variables.
­Survey responses were stratified by site, years of experience, and number
of studies affected by HIPAA provisions.
For the semi-structured interviews, qualitative information provided
by the respondents was synthesized to determine the characteristics of the
affected studies. The content of the interviews was also analyzed to identify
recurrent themes.
IRB Administrator Survey
A mailed survey was used to collect data about IRB administrators’
experience with the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The IRB administrators were
the 15 who work at the HMO Research Network sites. Responses were
received from 11 of the 15 sites. The survey was developed by Sarah
Greene, with input and review by the IOM Committee. The survey asked
questions regarding:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

The role of the IRB as it relates to HIPAA Privacy Rule compliance
Knowledge of and attitudes toward the research-related provisions
of the HIPAA Privacy Rule
Procedures in place (or planned) to ensure adherence to HIPAA
Privacy Rule provisions
Approaches (e.g., training, new staff) established at the site to
address HIPAA compliance
Specific type of HIPAA Privacy Rule–related training/education
developed by the site’s IRB

Glossary

Accounting of Disclosures: This provision of the Privacy Rule gives individuals the right to receive a list of certain disclosures that a covered entity
has made of their protected health information in the past 6 years, including
disclosures made for research purposes.
Association for the Accreditation of Human Research Protection Programs,
Inc. (AAHRPP): An independent, nonprofit entity that accredits organizations’ human research protection programs.
Authorization: An individual’s written permission to allow a covered entity
to use or disclose specified protected health information (PHI) for a particular purpose. Authorization states how, why, and to whom the PHI will
be used and/or disclosed for research, and seeks permission for that use or
disclosure.
Autonomy: The capacity of a rational individual to make an informed,
uncoerced decision.
Business Associate: A person or entity who, on behalf of a covered entity,
performs or assists in performance of a function or activity involving the
use or disclosure of protected health information, such as data analysis,
claims processing or administration, utilization review, and quality assurance reviews, or any other function or activity regulated by the HIPAA
Administrative Simplification Rules, including the Privacy Rule. Business
associates are also persons or entities performing legal, actuarial, account315

ing, consulting, data aggregation, management, administrative, accreditation, or financial services to or for a covered entity where performing those
services involves disclosure of protected health information by the covered
entity or another business associate of the covered entity to that person or
entity.
Chronic Conditions Warehouse: Section 723 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 instructed the
Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to make
Medicare data more readily available to researchers studying chronic illness in the Medicare population, with the intent to help “identify areas
for improving the quality of care provided to chronically ill Medicare
beneficiaries, [and] reduce program spending.” The Chronic Conditions
Warehouse implements this requirement of the Act and contains fee-forservices claims, enrollment/eligibility, and assessment data. Researchers can
efficiently access data on 21 predefined chronic health conditions, such as
diabetes, breast cancer, Alzheimer’s, and depression.
Common Rule: The federal rule that governs most federally funded research
conducted on human beings and aims to ensure that the rights of human
subjects are protected during the course of a research project, historically focusing on protection from physical and mental harm by stressing
autonomy and consent.
Confidentiality: Addresses the issue of how personal data that have been
collected for one approved person may be held and used by the organization that collected the data, what other secondary or further uses may be
made of the data, and when the permission of the individual is required
for such uses.
Covered Entity: A health plan, a health care clearinghouse, or a health care
provider that transmits health information in electronic form in connection
with a transaction for which the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services has adopted a standard.
Data Use Agreement: An agreement into which the covered entity enters
with the intended recipient of a limited dataset that establishes the ways in
which the information in the limited dataset may be used and how it will
be protected.
Deidentified Information: The Privacy Rule provides for two methods to
deidentify personally identifiable health information. Under the statistical
method, a statistician or person with appropriate training verifies that enough

Effectiveness: The extent to which a specific test or intervention, when used
under ordinary circumstances, does what it is intended to do.
Efficacy: The extent to which a specific test or intervention produces a
beneficial result under ideal conditions (e.g., a clinical trial).
Fair Information Practices: Principles affording individuals the meaningful right to control the collection, use, and disclosure of information, and
imposing affirmative responsibilities to safeguard information on those
who collect it.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Protection of Human Subjects Regulations: Regulations intended to protect the rights of human subjects
enrolled in research involving products that the FDA regulates (i.e., drugs,
medical devices, biologicals, foods, and cosmetics).

service, repricing company, community health management information
system or community health information system, and value-added networks
and switches, that either process or facilitate the processing of health information received from another entity in a nonstandard format or containing
nonstandard data content into standard data elements or a standard transaction, or receive a standard transaction from another entity and process
or facilitate the processing of health information into a nonstandard format
or nonstandard data content for the receiving entity.
Health Care Provider: A provider of services (as defined in Section 1861(u)
of HIPAA, 42 U.S.C. 1395x(u)), a provider of medical or health services (as
defined in Section 1861(s) of HIPAA, 42 U.S.C. 1395x(s)), and any other
person or organization who furnishes, bills, or is paid for health care in the
normal course of business.
Health Information: Any information, whether oral or recorded in any
form or medium, that (1) is created or received by a health care provider,
health plan, public health authority, employer, life insurer, school or university, or health care clearinghouse; and (2) relates to the past, present, or

Act that requires, among other things, under the Administrative Simplification subtitle, the adoption of standards for protecting the privacy and
security of personally identifiable health information.
Hybrid Entity: A single legal entity that is a covered entity, performs business activities that include both covered and non-covered functions, and
designates its health care components as provided in the Privacy Rule. If

to its designated health care components. However, non-health care components of a hybrid entity may be business associates of one or more of its
health care components, depending on the nature of the relationship.
Informed Consent: A legal form required by the Common Rule that
describes the potential risks and benefits of research and seeks permission
to involve the subject.
Institutional Review Boards (IRBs): “An administrative body established
to protect the rights and welfare of human research subjects recruited
to participate in research activities conducted under the auspices of the
institution with it is affiliated. The IRB has the authority to approve,
require modification in, or disapprove all research activities that fall
within its jurisdiction as specified by both the federal regulations and
local institutional policy” (Department of Health and Human Services
IRB Guidebook).
Limited Dataset: Refers to protected health information that excludes 16
categories of direct identifiers and may be used or disclosed, for purposes of
research, public health, or health care operations, without obtaining either
an individual’s authorization or a waiver or an alteration of authorization
for its use and disclosure, with a data use agreement.
Nonmaleficence: The ethical principle of doing no harm, based on the
­Hippocratic maxim, primum non nocere, first do no harm.
Privacy: In this report, the privacy of personal health information pertains
to the collection, storage, and use of personal information and addresses
the question of who has access to personal information and under what
conditions.
Privacy Board: A board that is established to review and approve requests
for waivers or alterations of authorization in connection with a use or disclosure of protected health information as an alternative to obtaining such

GLOSSARY

waivers or alterations from an Institutional Review Board. A Privacy Board
consists of members with varying backgrounds and appropriate ­professional
competencies as necessary to review the effect of the research protocol on
an individual’s privacy rights and related interests. The board must include
at least one member who is not affiliated with the covered entity, is not
affiliated with any entity conducting or sponsoring the research, and is not
related to any person who is affiliated with any such entities. A Privacy
Board cannot have any member participating in a review of any project in
which the member has a conflict of interest.
Protected Health Information: Protected health information is personally
identifiable health information created or received by a covered entity.
Public Health: The Privacy Rule defines a public health authority as any
“federal, tribal, or local agency or person or entity acting under a grant of
authority or contract with the agency, including state and local health departments, the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.”
Public Health Practice: “The collection and analysis of identifiable health
data by a public health authority for the purpose of protecting the health
of a particular community, where the benefits and risks are primarily
designed to accrue to the participating community” (Hodge, 2005; Hodge
and Gostin, 2004).
Public Health Research: “The collection and analysis of identifiable health
data by a public health authority for the purpose of generating knowledge
that will benefit those beyond the participating community who bear the
risks of participation” (Hodge, 2005; Hodge and Gostin, 2004).
Public Responsibility in Medicine and Research (PRIM&R): An organization whose mission is to promote ethical research in both humans and
animals.
Quality Improvement: “Systematic, data-guided activities designed to bring
about immediate, positive change in the delivery of health care in a particular setting” (Baily et al., 2006).

treated as autonomous agents, and that individuals with diminished
­autonomy are entitled to protection (HEW, 1979).
Security: “The procedural and technical measures required (a) to prevent
unauthorized access, modification, use, and dissemination of data stored
or processed in a computer system, (b) to prevent any deliberate denial of
service, and (c) to protect the system in its entirety from physical harm”
(Turn and Ware, 1976).
Selection Bias: This phenomenon occurs when data are more likely to be
collected from one subset of the population than from a representative
sample of the entire population. This can cause systematic differences
between the characteristics of the individuals included in a study and the
individuals not included.
Waiver of Authorization: The documentation that the covered entity obtains
from a researcher or an IRB or a Privacy Board that states that the IRB or
Privacy Board has waived or altered the Privacy Rule’s requirement that an
individual must authorize a covered entity to use or disclose the individual’s
