The Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) was implemented in November 2021 to safeguard the personal
information rights and interests of Internet users in China. However, the impact and existing shortcomings of
the PIPL remain unclear, carrying significant implications for policymakers. This study examined privacy
policies on 13 online platforms before and after the PIPL. Concurrently, it conducted semi-structured interviews
with 30 Chinese Internet users to assess their perceptions of the PIPL. Users were also given tasks to identify
non-compliance within the platforms, assessing their ability to address related privacy concerns effectively.
The research revealed various instances of non-compliance in post-PIPL privacy policies, especially concerning
inadequate risk assessments for sensitive data. Although users identified some non-compliant activities like
app eavesdropping, issues related to individual consent proved challenging. Surprisingly, over half of the
interviewees believed that the government could access their personal data without explicit consent. Our
findings and implications can be valuable for lawmakers, online platforms, users, and future researchers
seeking to enhance personal privacy practices both in China and globally.

INTRODUCTION

With the widespread availability of smartphones and mobile Internet, users have come to rely on
online platforms and applications for everything from business transactions and communication
to transportation and entertainment [9, 15]. As such online platforms provide highly tailored,
personalized services, they often utilize vast amounts of personal information such as fingerprints,
facial data, financial details, and users’ locations [24, 29, 40]. The collection of such data has raised
significant privacy concerns, given the extensive access that such online platforms have to users’
personal information [24, 60]. Recently, there have been instances where online platforms have
collected and used user data without the informed consent of, or proper disclosure to, users. For
example, in July 2022, Didi, the Chinese equivalent of Uber, was fined CNY 8 billion (USD 1.2 billion)
for excessively collecting and unlawfully processing 64.7 billion personal data [46].
The need to protect individuals’ privacy has thus been a focal point of the legislation introduced
in many regions and countries [24]. In Europe, for example, the General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR) regulates the collection and handling of personal information and provides enhanced
privacy protection across various sectors, such as financial markets, Internet of Things devices,
and healthcare [2, 13, 17, 35, 49]. Following the implementation of GDPR, Europe saw a significant
decline in privacy-invasive issues [53].
Other regions and countries have also taken steps to enact their own data and privacy protection laws. For example, in China, the Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) of the People’s
Republic of China was approved in August 2021 [47] and invoked in November 2021. The PIPL
aimed to protect personal information rights, standardize information handling practices, specify comprehensive and rigorous provisions regarding informed user consent, and promote the
responsible use of personal data [47]. The PIPL is the first legislation specifically designed to
safeguard personal information and address the prevalent privacy concerns across numerous online
platforms [11, 12, 16, 45]. Since its implementation in November 2021, the Chinese government has
taken decisive measures to address illegal activities relating to personal information protection,
while online platforms operating in China have made operational adjustments to ensure that they
are compliant with PIPL’s requirements [3, 11].
Prior to the invocation of PIPL, the legislative landscape in China was fragmented and provided
inadequate protection for individuals’ rights [70]. The PIPL represented an important step towards
enhancing the privacy ecosystem in China and could be a valuable tool to mitigate the prevalent
privacy infringements in the country [11]. However, the degree to which compliance with the PIPL
has resulted in increased privacy protections for Chinese citizens is currently unknown. Further, as
many of the non-compliant activities that online platforms can exhibit can pose substantial threats
to user privacy (e.g., unauthorized access to personal information), users’ abilities to identify and
perceive such activities play a crucial role when deciding whether to use an online platform. Guided
by these concerns, this research sought to answer the following research questions:
• RQ1: What has the effect of the PIPL been on personal information protection and online
platforms’ compliance?
• RQ2: Can users recognize non-compliant activities in privacy policies?
• RQ3: What are users’ perceptions towards these non-compliant activities?
An analysis of the privacy policies of 13 popular online platforms in China, such as WeChat,
QQ, and Douyin, was conducted to answer these research questions. The analysis compared the
privacy policies before and after the PIPL was invoked to identify any significant changes that
resulted. This process identified different types of non-compliance activities within post-PIPL
privacy policies, including the absence of personal information risk assessments for handling
sensitive data, inconvenient consent revocation processes, and insufficient measures to separate the

notification and acquisition of individual consent. To gain insights into users’ abilities to recognize
non-compliant activities and understand their perceptions of these activities, semi-structured
interviews were conducted with 30 Chinese Internet users who actively engaged with the 13
platforms. These interviews highlighted how interviewees could identify non-compliant activities
such as app eavesdropping and the excessive collection of personal information. However, they
struggled to identify non-compliant activities related to individuals’ separate consent. Moreover,
approximately half of the interviewees believed the government should collect and handle their
personal information without explicit consent.
This research thus makes several contributions to HCI and CSCW, including:
• A summary of the changes and instances of non-compliant activities observed in the privacy
policies of 13 popular online platforms in China.
• An identification of the challenges faced by laypersons when comprehending PIPL and
verifying platform compliance.
• An uncovering of the privacy concerns specific to the Chinese cultural context, e.g., Chinese
Internet users were more concerned with information leakage rather than whether their data
was being collected and stored.
• Recommendations for lawmakers, personal information processors, users, and future researchers to enhance personal information practices in China and worldwide.

PERSONAL INFORMATION PROTECTION LAW (PIPL)

Effective November 2021, PIPL was China’s first law specifically designed to protect personal
information [47]. The purposes of PIPL were to secure personal information rights and interests
and regulate the rules governing the processing and utilization of personal information [7, 44].
The PIPL defined personal information as “various kinds of information related to identified
or identifiable natural persons recorded by electronic or other means, excluding the information
processed anonymously (Article 4)” [47]. It stated the processing of personal information, including
“collection, storage, use, processing, transmission, provision, publication, and erasure of personal
information (Article 4)” [47]. Personal information processing activities only occurred under special
legal circumstances, for example, after receiving consent from the data’s user, collecting information
related to public health emergencies, the information exposed by data subjects themselves, and
so on (Article 13). Similar to GDPR, PIPL applied the data minimization principle to personal
information processing activities to restrict a personal information processor from collecting
unnecessary and unauthorized personal information (Article 6). The data minimization principle
was that “collection of personal information shall be limited to the minimum scope for processing
and excessive collection of personal information shall not be allowed (Article 6)” [47]. The PIPL also
specified special information collection rules, including those on sensitive personal information
processing and the processing of personal information by the government (Section 2, 3, Chapter II).
Sensitive personal information was considered to be information that would lessen one’s reputation
or personal and property security (Article 28). As PIPL also considered all information related to
children under 14 years of age as sensitive information, if a personal information processor wanted
to utilize such data, it needed to acquire consent from the children’s parents or guardians (Article
31). For state organs, PIPL enabled such entities to gather and use personal information as needed
without consent.
PIPL also introduced user privacy rights, for example, the right to be informed, the right to reject
personal information processing activities, the right for a user to inquire and copy their personal
information from a relevant personal information processor, and the right to correct or delete one’s
personal information. Furthermore, during personal information processing activities, PIPL enabled

users to withdraw their consent from a personal information processor during consent-based
processing activities (Article 15). If automated decision-making significantly impacted users’ profits
and interests, PIPL permitted users to reject automated decision-making or acquire a comprehensive
explanation from the personal information processor (Article 24).

RELATED WORK

Of most relevance to the present research is the literature on the degree to which online platforms
complied with GDPR, users’ privacy concerns, and their perceptions about personal information
protection laws within the context of GDPR, and attitudes and concerns about privacy held by
non-Western users.
3.1

Compliance with GDPR

GDPR has been regarded as an efficient tool to protect users’ data [5], and it has been believed
that good compliance with GDPR would decrease privacy-invasive problems and improve privacy
environments [53]. Previous studies have made efforts to understand the degree to which privacy
policies are compliant with GDPR [4, 6, 18, 30, 39, 43, 63] and many researchers have found
several non-compliance issues [18, 39, 43, 63]. For example, Mohan et al. found several general
GDPR non-compliance activities that occurred on large-scale cloud services when analyzing the
privacy policies of cloud services after GDPR was published [43]. Moreover, Kyi et al. focus on the
ambiguous design and description in privacy policies, they summarized the deceptive strategies
used in privacy notices, such as hiding legitimate privacy information at the end of privacy policies,
using complicated procedures to revoke one’s permission after it had been granted for access by the
data processor, and the use of linguistic tricks when writing privacy policies, such as providing an
implicit definition of legitimate interests to users or even do not give any specific explanation [34].
They also found that non-compliant platforms had ambiguous data processing and sharing rules,
mentioned a few explicit durations that they would maintain users’ personal information, and
used inappropriate methods to alert users about privacy policy updates, thus providing users
with little power to control their data. Fan et al. explored the common situations in that data
processors violated the GDPR, they summarized three GDPR requirements for protecting users’
personal information that were violated by personal information processors [18], i.e., they provided
insufficient data processing records to users, they obtained user data in excess of what was declared
in their privacy policies. Moreover, they lacked appropriate security approaches to protect users’
personal information. Bowyer et al. also highlighted the difficulties that users had when attempting
to access their personal information, such as insufficient transparency on information handling
and transportation and confusing information on the personal data that could be exported [5].
To improve compliance with GDPR, researchers have also explored the design of innovative
systems to provide better enforcement [1, 8, 62, 67, 68]. Campanile et al., for example, proposed a
reference model to manage the information within the Internet of Vehicles, such as locations and
personal habits, utilizing block-chains [8].
The research above provided evidence that non-compliance activities still exist, even after the
invocation of GDPR. Similarly, we assumed that the same situation occurred after the invocation of
PIPL, so we analyzed the most popular Chinese online platforms’ privacy policies to determine
their degree of compliance with PIPL.
3.2

Western Attitudes Towards GDPR

Current research has explored personal information protection laws, especially since the introduction of GDPR. When GDPR was first implemented in Europe, researchers explored GDPR’s
execution and impact [37, 55] in fields such as healthcare [21, 35], the Internet of Things [49, 64],
Proc. ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact., Vol. 8, No. CSCW1, Article 138. Publication date: April 2024.

Personal Information Protection Law Compliance and Perceptions in China

and the economy [2]. As GDPR aimed to protect users’ privacy, a large amount of research explored
users’ perceptions and awareness of GDPR and which GDPR regulations were connected to privacy
concerns [19, 32, 41, 50, 51]. For example, Tahal and Formanek investigated attitudes towards
GDPR from the perspective of Czech Republic citizens [61]. In their study, participants thought that
GDPR was mostly helpful but somewhat annoying, and they doubted that GDPR could affect data
processing. Strycharz et al. conducted a survey of 1288 users in the Netherlands to explore their
understanding of GDPR and its aims and gather their reactions to GDPR [59]. The results showed
that most users had a high awareness of GDPR and individual rights. However, they questioned
the effectiveness of GDPR with respect to individual rights. Furthermore, González et al. noted
that there were six dimensions of GDPR that were associated with users’ privacy concerns, i.e.
data collection, data handling and storage, ownership agency, privacy and security items, security
mechanisms, and privacy and security risks [22].
Previous researchers have made efforts to understand various aspects of GDPR for protecting
users’ privacy, including GDPR’s implementation and impact and users’ perception and awareness
of GDPR. Similar as GDPR, the PIPl is also the law protecting users’ privacy information. Moreover,
the PIPL is the first official and legal law to protect users’ information in China. Therefore, PIPL
has a noticeable influence on Chinese society and industry. Furthermore, China has almost 1.4
billion population in the world, which is 20% of the world population. Therefore, we are motivated
to investigate PIPL’s implementation and impact and Chinese citizens’ perceptions and awareness
of PIPL in this research.
3.3

Non-Western Privacy Concerns

Non-Western Privacy Concerns occupy a central role in the complex landscape of online privacy
attitudes and behaviors. While much research has focused on Western users, few studies have
delved into the distinct privacy concerns of non-Western individuals. For instance, Wang et al.
compared Chinese and American users’ attitudes toward Online Behavioral Advertising, which
involved tracking users’ online behaviors and found that Chinese users were more likely to share
their private data and were less concerned about potential privacy problems than Americans [65].
They guessed the reason for Chinese users’ behaviors is that Chinese companies have more power
to control Online Behavior Advertising than American companies [65]. Herbert et al. found that
users from non-Western countries (China, India, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and South Africa) exhibited
more misconceptions about security and privacy topics than Western users, suggesting that cultural
and contextual factors play a significant role in shaping privacy attitudes and behaviors. [28].
Furthermore, Fife and Orjuela compared privacy concerns between Japanese and American users and
described that the concepts of “private” and “public” differed. Japanese users believed that “private”
belongs to “public” [20]. Stokes et al. illustrated that using different languages to explain the same
privacy policy results in different privacy concerns [57]. These concerns are shaped by a multitude of
factors, encompassing cultural, linguistic, cognitive, and contextual elements. Kokolakis’ exploration
of the information privacy paradox further deepens this intricate web of influences. The study
uncovers a common thread among individuals, transcending cultural backgrounds, wherein the
allure of social rewards frequently leads them to divulge private information, causing their privacy
behaviors to deviate from their stated privacy concerns [33].
Other researchers specifically investigated the Chinese privacy environment. For example,
Roberts found that Chinese citizens tolerated a lack of privacy when the government obtained
their personal information because the government promised specific data acquisition measures
would be taken [52]. Wang and Yu interviewed Chinese users and found that they resisted giving
their personal information to enterprises and the government and instead provided fake personal
information to them [66].

These lines of research were primarily interested in how non-Western users were concerned
about their privacy and to what extent they would choose to protect their privacy in practice.
However, a significant gap was observed between users’ privacy concerns and their actual privacy
protection behaviors, leading to unexpected privacy risks. Given these findings, our research is
motivated by the desire to understand whether similar challenges exist among Chinese internet
users.

REVIEW OF POPULAR ONLINE PLATFORMS’ PRIVACY POLICIES (STUDY 1):
METHOD

After the invocation of PIPL, online platforms made changes to their operations, of which changes
to their privacy polices were the most apparent. To better understand compliance with PIPL, and
thus online platforms’ abilities to protect the privacy of their users, we compared the privacy
policies of 13 widely-used online platforms [10] before and after PIPL was invoked.
4.1

Online Platform Selection

The online platforms were selected based on the 48th Statistical Report on China’s Internet Development [10]. First, we removed those online platform service types whose user utilization rate is below
70%. The remaining online platforms service types were instant messaging, online video, online
payment, online shopping, search engines, and online news. Next, we selected online platforms
from each online platform service type based on their rankings in the Harmony, Andriod, and IOS
app stores. We then manually ranked the remaining platforms by user quantity, number of daily
active users, and number of monthly active users. Finally, we chose between 1 and 4 platforms in
the top 4 positions on our manually ranked list of each platform service type. The quantity we
chose for each online platform service type was based on the user statistics and the percentage
of users using the platform. The remaining 13 platforms included social media platforms such as
WeChat ,QQ, WeiBo, and RED, video platforms like Douyin, BiliBili„ iQiyi and Kuaishou, digital
payment platforms such as Alipay, shopping platforms including Taobao and Jingdong, and the
Jinritoutiao platform.
4.2

Data Analysis

Firstly, this paper collected privacy policies published before and after PIPL’s invocation for every
online platforms. Next, this paper investigate the difference between privacy policies of same
online platform to figure out how the PIPL to protect user privacy from online platforms. The
difference were concluded by using keywords-in-context and text mining qualitative analyses [48]
and applying measurement estimate approaches [56]. The differences between the old and new
privacy policies demonstrate the efforts made by the PIPL to protect individual privacy. The new
policies grant individuals the right to copy their personal information, which was not mentioned in
the old version. Additionally, the new policies offer more comprehensive and detailed information
regarding data processing activities compared to the previous version.
We then performed an analysis to determine how compliant privacy policies that published
after PIPL’s invocation were to the PIPL regulations. This data analysis was based on an open
coding method [69], wherein the first author and the third author (a legal researcher), reviewed the
compliance of the post-PIPL privacy polices and identified instances were the activities did not
appear to be compliant. Next, the second author reviewed the activities identified by the first and
third author in the privacy policies, and to compare the activities with the PIPL again to increase
the accuracy of compliance of privacy policies. Then, these three authors discussed the identified
activities to achieve consistency. If the three authors were not able to reach a consensus, an addition
researchers was brought in and an affinity diagramming activity [26] was performed to rectify

the disagreements. The privacy policies were analyzed by the first and second authors, and the
accuracy of the results was reviewed by two legal researchers (the third and fourth).

REVIEW OF POPULAR CHINESE PLATFORMS’ PRIVACY POLICIES (STUDY 1):
RESULTS

Herein, we describe the changes that were found in the privacy policies of the selected online
platforms after the invocation of PIPL. We also describe the non-compliant activities that was
identified within the first post-PIPL privacy policies published by each online platform.
5.1

Changes to Privacy Policies Post-PIPL Invocation

Several privacy policies did improve after the invocation of PIPL (Table 1). In general, we identified
three different types of changes in Post-PIPL privacy policies (Table 2): 1) the use of clearer language
within privacy policies, 2) online platforms taking an expanded scope of responsibilities, and 3)
additional and stronger user rights being specified.

5.1.1 Utilization of Clearer Language. Online platforms made efforts to simplify and clarify their
privacy policies. They reduced their use of specialized vocabulary and provided more concise rules
related to information collection, handling, and sharing. In cases where simplification was not feasible, online platforms supplemented the specialized vocabulary with clearer explanations. Notably,
four online platforms included a comprehensive list of their data sharing activities, encompassing
the personal information processors involved, the types of information shared, the purposes of the
sharing, and the methods of handling and processing the data. While some details were lacking in
the provided lists, these efforts improved the transparency and user-friendliness of explaining the
utilization of user data.
5.1.2 Expanded Scope of Online Platform Responsibilities. Four online platforms expanded the scope
of their responsibilities detailed in their privacy policy to inform users about the online platform’s
responsibilities. For example, Kuaishou’s updated privacy policies included provisions to notify
users in the event of major changes, such as sharing users’ personal information with unauthorized
handlers or significant alterations to the online platform’s ownership and organizational structure.
Additionally, two online platforms specified reduced conditions under which individual consent
could be waived, with Taobao eliminating all instances of a consent waiver. Furthermore, nearly all

After PIPL Invocation
“Our business partners may need your personal information
to improve their advertisement and relevant services, which
includes your device information, network, advertisement

advertisement display rate.” (Jinritoutiao)
“You understand and agree that according to the law,
anonymized personal information is not personal information.
We do not need to inform you and obtain your consent for the
sharing, transferring, and public disclosure of such data.”
(Pinduoduo)
“System permissions such as address book, location, camera,

enabled by default. The above permissions will only be accessed
for specific services/functions after obtaining your separate
consent.” (iQiyi)
“We will transfer your information when encountering
commercial cooperation, joint, merging, purchasing, asset or
any similar transactions. We will provide you with the receiving
company’s name and contact information. Meanwhile, we will request the
receivers to obey our privacy policies unless they request your
consent.” (Pinduoduo)
“If you successfully cancel the account, we will delete or
anonymize your personal information immediately.”
(Jingdong)
“You could check, copy, and download your personal
information.” (Kuaishou)

online platforms introduced regulations that required separate consent from individuals, such as
Douyin’s practice of obtaining separate consent when collecting facial feature information.
5.1.3 Additional and Stronger User Rights. Nine online platforms implemented significant changes
to expand and enhance users’ privacy rights. WeChat, for example, introduced a user portal that
empowered users to manage permissions and authorizations, thus simplifying their decisionmaking. In addition, WeChat expanded users’ access to information, such as enabling them to view
their interaction history with other videos. Notably, WeChat enabled users to browse and export
their personal information through a “Rights” section, thereby enhancing their ability to easily
copy their data. Similarly, Douyin took steps to protect users’ rights by ensuring that users refusing
to authorize access to specific information only affected the use of directly related services. Douyin
also introduced rules regarding the rights to copy and transfer data. While Douyin did not provide
a self-export option, it guaranteed that users would be able to copy and transfer their data.
5.2

Non-Compliant Activities Specified in Privacy Policies

Several non-compliant activities were identified in the post-PIPL privacy policies and were loosely
grouped into four categories (Table 3). Similar to prior work [27, 43], we also found non-compliant
activities such as unclear data sharing policies, unclaimed information collecting and processing,
vague data retention policies, and insufficient data protection.
5.2.1 Inadequate Risk Assessments of Sensitive Personal Information. According to PIPL, online
platforms were obligated to conduct risk assessments and inform users about the risks associated
with them handling users’ sensitive personal information. Moreover, the law requires higher-level
risk assessments and stronger safeguards for sensitive personal information compared to common
information. Only four online platforms, however, demonstrated full compliance with this law, while
five online platforms failed to address risk assessments in their privacy policies. Notably, QQ and
WeChat, both owned by Tencent, exhibited similar privacy rules, mentioning risk assessments only
in the context of providing sensitive personal information to the public. Similarly, RED mentioned
risk assessments but only during data sharing activities. On the other hand, Weibo provided a

Table 4. The results of evaluating the compliance of platforms’ terms for the right to copy. This example
shows the outcomes for three online platforms. The evaluation results fell into one of four categories: Yes, No,
Not Applicable, and Not Mentioned.

Metrics Evaluating the Compliance with Right to Copy
Does the platform provide users with the right to copy?
Can users copy their information by themselves?
If users can exercise the right to copy by themselves, are
the operations convenient (i.e., within five steps)?

rudimentary risk assessment but lacked a more sophisticated and specific assessment for handling
sensitive information.
5.2.2 Insufficient Consent Revocation Mechanisms. Among the thirteen online platforms we reviewed, three failed to provide users with a method to revoke consent and four required users to
take more than five steps to revoke consent, both of which are in direct violation of Article 15 of
PIPL [47]. RED, for example, did not offer any means for users to revoke their consent and Alipay
required that users perform eight steps to revoke their consent.
5.2.3 Inadequate Implementation of Right to Copy and Right to Transfer. We conducted an evaluation
of online platforms’ compliance of the right to copy that considered three key metrics: provision
of the right, a user’s ability to copy their information independently, and the convenience of the
copying process (Table 4).
Of the online platforms examined, four online platforms did not mention the right to copy in
their privacy policies, while six did not enable users to copy their data on their own. For example,
iQiYi offered users two methods to copy their data: submitting an application to the online platform

or contacting consumer service. However, among the remaining three online platforms, WeChat
users were required to complete a cumbersome process involving five steps to obtain their data.
Furthermore, the evaluation extended to the right to transfer, revealing a similar trend, wherein
the guarantees provided for the right to transfer were insufficient and mirrored the observations
from the right to copy (Table 3).
5.2.4 Deficiencies in Obtaining Separate Individual Consent. A common issue that arose related to
online platforms’ failure to implement separate notifications and obtain separate consent from users.
According to PIPL, separate consent is required in situations including the collection of sensitive
information, the disclosure of personal information to third parties, and the public processing
of personal information. All online platforms exhibited varying degrees of compliance, such as
specifying modifications to processing purposes and sharing personal information with other
information processors. For instance, Weibo’s privacy regulations failed to specify that they would
obtainseparate consent from individuals when commissioning other online platforms to process
personal information.
It is worth noting that certain language in the privacy policies subsequent to PIPL’s invocation
described activities that were no longer considered to be compliant. Taobao, for example, removed
the regulation “Regular disclosure of risk assessment and information handling” from its new
privacy policy [47]. This resulted in it not being compliant with the regulation “The collection
and processing of sensitive personal information requires prior personal information protection
impact assessment and handling, and notification”. Similarly, Jingdong had removed the clause “We
will take all reasonable and feasible measures to ensure that no unrelated personal information is
collected” from its new privacy policy [31]. The removal of this provision meant that Jingdong was
no longer committed to ensuring that it collected the minimum amount of personal information,
which violated the minimum data collection principle in PIPL. In addition, Jingdong deleted the
clause “Security protection measures in the delivery system to prevent users’ sensitive information
from being exposed in the delivery process”. This action signalled a decrease in Jingdong’s level of
protection of sensitive personal information.
5.2.5 Summary. Our findings revealed that nine online platforms made privacy policy modifications in response to PIPL and there were several significant changes, including online platforms
using clearer language, taking more responsibility, and providing additional and stronger user
rights. In the evaluation of the non-compliant activities described in privacy policies, four main
types of non-compliance activities were found: risk assessments for sensitive personal information,
insufficient consent revocation mechanisms, deficiencies in implementing the right to copy and
transfer, and shortcomings in obtaining separate individual consent. Overall, the findings indicate
that online platforms have responded to PIPL’s requirements, however, there is still ample room
for improvement before online platforms can be said to be in full compliance with PIPL.

UNDERSTANDING USERS’ PERCEPTIONS OF PIPL (STUDY 2): METHOD

To better understand Chinese Internet users’ perceptions of PIPL and their abilities to recognize
non-compliant activities, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 30 interviewees. During
the interviews, interviewees were also asked to perform some simple tasks, such as searching
through a privacy policy to find any non-compliant activities that were specified.
6.1

Interviewees

From March to August 2022, we advertised a pre-survey on the Douban platform to recruit interviewees. In the survey, potential interviewees were asked basic questions about their demographics
(i.e., age, occupation), knowledge of PIPL, and their attitudes toward PIPL. For example, we asked
Proc. ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact., Vol. 8, No. CSCW1, Article 138. Publication date: April 2024.

Personal Information Protection Law Compliance and Perceptions in China

138:11

“Have you heard about Personal Information Protection Law before the survey?” and “In general, to
what extent will you take measures to protect your privacy when using the platform?”.
We received a total of 572 responses for further selection. To mitigate sample limitations, we
made efforts to maximize sample diversity based on demographic information, knowledge level
of PIPL, and attitudes towards privacy. Eventually, we selected 30 interviewees from various
occupations, including lawyers, government staff, freelancers, unemployed individuals, policy
analysis & consulting practitioners, and legal advisors. Among the interviewees, 17 were male and
13 were female (Table A1 in the Appendix A). Most interviewees had at least a college education,
however, some had completed only junior education. The breakdown of interviewee responses to
the pre-survey questions can be found in Table C1 in Appendix B.
6.2

Interview Procedure

Between April and August 2022, the semi-structured interviews were conducted in Mandarin
Chinese using WeChat and QQ audio calls. In total, we implemented more than 30 interviews
including the repeated interviews. Every interview lasted between 40 to 90 minutes via WeChat
or QQ voice calls and each interviewee was paid ¥50 CNY (about $7.40 USD). All interviews were
recorded with interviewees’ consent.
During the interview, interviewees were asked a series of questions about their daily Internet
usage, their awareness and understanding of PIPL, their perceptions about how online platforms
handled their privacy and personal information, how they learned about what information online
platforms collected about them and how online platforms collected such information, online
platforms’ consent procedures, and non-compliant activities they have observed (see Appendix B).
Then, we asked interviewees to complete two short tasks. During Task 1, interviewees were
asked find the list of personal information that was collected by the online platform they mentioned
in the interview and screen record themselves doing so. Then, interviewees were asked to determine
if any unexpected information was mentioned in this list. Following this, we asked interviewees
about their perceptions of any unexpected information they found. If this activity changed an
interviewees’ perceptions about privacy, we asked them any relevant semi-structured interview
questions again, and we report both users’ perception before and after the interview.
During Task 2, interviewees were asked to find any non-compliant terms that existed in the
privacy policies from their two most frequently used platforms. For each platform, we selected
two sections from the privacy policies that did not fully fulfill the requirements of PIPL and sent
screenshots to interviewees on WeChat for them to read before asking them questions about the
sections. For example, we displayed the information collection list from the platform’s privacy
policy that they used most frequently. Then we asked them, “Do you think the app target collected
information is excessive? Does the platform request your individual separate consent before collecting
your information in the information list?”.
6.3

Data Analysis

A combination of automatic transcription and manual rectification were used to transcribe the
audio from the interviews. All recognizable, identifiable, and sensitive personal information in the
data was removed to protect our interviewees’ privacy. Then, a grounded theory approach [14, 69]
was used to evaluate the interview outcomes. First, we used open coding to review the interview
transcripts [69]. Two native Mandarin-speaking authors then coded the interview transcriptions
separately. Then, two authors discussed the resulting codes and resolved any disagreements until
reaching a mutual agreement. Next, they were attempted to find conceptual-level themes [54]. Then,
the research team utilized affinity diagramming [26] to extract themes from the data, repeatedly
Proc. ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact., Vol. 8, No. CSCW1, Article 138. Publication date: April 2024.

revised them, and grouped them by sub-category [58]. Grounded theory was used to simplify and
summarize the collected data and convert it into general conclusion [38].

UNDERSTANDING USERS’ PERCEPTIONS OF PIPL (STUDY 2): RESULTS

Overall, over half of interviewees demonstrated a high level of awareness of PIPL, or at least knew
the purpose and basic principles of PIPL. (Table C1) About 70 percent of interviewees thought
PIPL was created to help every citizen, however, one interviewee thought that PIPL was created to
help China’s defense and security, as P7 described, “When I came across this law on WeChat public
account, it seemed to emphasize the procedures and regulations required for data transmission overseas”.
Some interviewees also said that they thought PIPL was trying to alleviate information leakage
and excessive information collection, e.g., “I think PIPL is used to reduce information leakage and
wrongdoings like spam calls. Some platforms must have revealed my phone number and identification
information, which caused many spam calls. The criminals even stated my identification number
precisely in the calls.” (P6).
Herein, the main findings from our study have been organized into four categories, i.e., general perceptions about privacy, the perceived effects of PIPL, non-compliant activities that were
unrecognizable, and the factors influencing the imperceptibility of these activities.
7.1

General Perceptions about Privacy

The analysis uncovered several ways that public awareness, online platforms’ user interfaces, and
learned tolerance influenced interviewees general perceptions about privacy within China.
7.1.1 Lack of Public Awareness. Many interviewees expressed concerns about the lack of public
awareness regarding personal information protection. P7 observed that privacy was not taken
seriously by most Chinese individuals and that they were insensitive to issues concerning personal information. P7 further remarked that if privacy were genuinely regarded as important, the
corresponding laws would have been proposed much earlier. Related to this, four interviewees
mentioned that many of their acquaintances were unfamiliar with PIPL. Though some of their
friends were familiar with PIPL, they did not have any ideas about how to protect their personal
information and defend their rights, which reflects the current level of public awareness about
privacy. P21 stated,
“I know that some apps definitely extracted my personal information in the background.
However, as an individual, what can I do? In many cases, I just turn a blind eye to it.”
P12 expressed that he had found many reports about non-compliant activity by online platforms,
however, he had never heard any news related to the outcomes of the cases, i.e., “the government’s
efforts to address non-compliant activities have been inadequate and the absence of reference cases
adds to our concerns”. For this interviewee, the unbalanced attention given to the entire privacy
enforcement process did not instill confidence in the effectiveness of any privacy measures that
were, or could be, invoked.
7.1.2 Interface Designs Prevented the Exercising of Rights. During the interviews, interviewees
mentioned that platforms implemented complex user interface designs, resulting in it being challenging for them to exercise their rights, such as revoking consent. However, interviewees did
not consider these complexities to be indicative of non-compliance. They understood that online
platforms implemented these designs to protect their own interests, albeit at the expense of user
convenience. These designs acted as a deterrent to exercise their rights because they had high
transaction costs, i.e., interviewees had to search for instructions on how to revoke consent or spend
Proc. ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact., Vol. 8, No. CSCW1, Article 138. Publication date: April 2024.

Personal Information Protection Law Compliance and Perceptions in China

138:13

additional time to click on an option to disagree. They felt that PIPL should focus on addressing
issues that significantly impact their interests rather than minor inconveniences.
7.1.3 Tolerance for Non-Compliant Activities. During the interviews, interviewees expressed that
protecting their personal information was an insurmountable challenge. They noted how it was
hard for them as an individual to defend their rights, e.g., “It is hard to fight with big companies.
Companies have a team of top lawyers, while I might have a civilian lawyer. I don’t know how I can
win against the companies” (P21).
As a result, several interviewees were accepting of certain non-compliant activities, such as
app eavesdropping (e.g., when a user chats with someone in an app (or in real life) and another
app recommends items mentioned in the conversation). Although P8 felt that app eavesdropping
made him less comfortable, he said he could sacrifice some of his privacy for the convenience
of using the app, “it’s kind of scary, but in this way (app eavesdropping) it reduces the cost of the
time of searching my interested items”. Thus, consistent with [36], there was a trade-off with more
interviewees opting to compromise their privacy in favor of convenience.
Additionally, interviewees expressed concerns about privacy in the age of Big Data. P6 shared
how he always had a sense of being monitored “ Once, I talked with my friend about where I planned
to travel on QQ. Within ten minutes, I opened Douyin without inputting any related information and
found the place that I chatted about appeared on my recommendation page”.
7.2

Perceived Effects of PIPL

Three main themes emerged in relation to the perceived effects of PIPL on interviewees, i.e.,
increased transparency, the transfer of government trust to privacy concerns, and the vagueness
that remains in PIPL’s language.
7.2.1 Increased Transparency. The transparency of online platforms post-PIPL was a common
topic. P11, who was an employee that worked on data processing at an Internet company, said
that an excess of unnecessary user data was collected by online platforms pre-PIPL, but that PIPL
aimed to ensure that online platforms only collected necessary data. Several interviewees also
noted that post-PIPL, the list of personal information that was collected by online platforms become
more visible. For example, P6 described how they became aware of PIPL through news reports that
“highlighted that certain platforms had made updates, openly displaying the data they collected from
users". They also noted how this led them to “explore WeChat and discover the data collection list ...
it was a novel experience for me, as I felt a newfound sense of respect for my privacy.”
7.2.2 Trust in the Government Transferred to Privacy. Four interviewees did not feel as if PIPL
had an effect on them, however, they still believed that their personal information privacy had
improved. Interviewees expressed that over the years, the government had improved their other
rights in many areas, including education, occupation, and consumption so they felt that PIPL
could also improve their rights on personal information. As P2 stated, “I personally haven’t noticed
any significant changes because I haven’t needed to exercise my rights under PIPL yet. However, I have
confidence in the government’s longstanding commitment to protecting our interests, and I believe that
PIPL is an important step towards safeguarding our personal information.”
7.2.3 Vagueness Inherent in PIPL’s Language. Three interviewees thought that the language used
within PIPL needed improvement, especially to remove concerns about vagueness in the terminology
used. For example, P11 was confused about the scope of the “emergency circumstances” noted
in Article 13 (4) when they were given an example of conditions of waiving consent, “There is
a regulation dedicated to protecting property security, but I wonder what criteria are used to
Proc. ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact., Vol. 8, No. CSCW1, Article 138. Publication date: April 2024.

138:14

Morgana Mo Zhou et al.

determine if a situation truly qualifies as an emergency.” Similarly, P17, who was a lawyer, stated
that
“Article 24 of PIPL provides conditions for automated decision making, but certain terms
like “significantly affecting” lack clarity. While PIPL mentions that users have the right to
reject automated decisions, it fails to specify an accessible process for exercising this right.
Additionally, Chapter VI, which addresses the responsibilities of departments performing
personal information protection duties, lacks an explicit delineation of specific obligations.
This ambiguity may pose challenges for users seeking to assert their rights.”
7.3

Recognizing Non-Compliant Activities

Interviewees exhibited a range of responses with respect to the non-compliant activities that
they correctly identified, incorrectly assumed were compliant, and incorrectly assumed were
non-compliant.
7.3.1 True Positive Non-Compliant Activities. Several factors were found to help interviewees
recognize non-compliant activities, such as having a legal knowledge background, legal regulations
being provided for reference, and interviewees’ previous experiences with the terminology used in
privacy policies. For those without a legal background, attention-grabbing text and visuals were
helpful when determining non-compliant activities. For example, when a bold font style was used
to highlight sensitive information, interviewees easily focused on it and were able to identify the
excessive collection of personal information.
Interviewees correctly believed that app eavesdropping was a non-compliant and illegal activity
since they thought that online platforms failed to ask them for permission to do so. Some interviewees thought that some data was collected without their permission, like device information,
however, most interviewees were unbothered by this as the collection of such non-sensitive data
would not influence their lives, e.g., “I hate platforms collecting my data without my permission but
it doesn’t matter because the leak of device information will be no impact on my life” (P3).
7.3.2 False Negative Non-Compliant Activities. During the interviews, we found that interviewees
incorrectly identified some activities as being compliant, for example, waiving consent. Surprisingly, we found that although interviewees believed their consent should be always obtained if
online platforms collected and handled their information, sixteen interviewees thought that the
government could collect and handle their personal information without their consent.
Two interviewees mentioned that Chinese people generally received a patriotic education, which
emphasized collectivism at a young age. P28 described that Chinese people tended to transfer
their love for country into trust in government since almost no one distinguished “country” and
“government” in China, i.e., “We’ve always been taught to be patriotic. Meanwhile, no one tells us the
differences between the state and the government. Many people feel that the state equals the government
and the trust in government somehow stems from the patriotism we have been taught.”
Some interviewees thus held altruistic beliefs and were willing to “sacrifice” their personal
information to contribute to society. For example, P12 felt that his personal information was a
way to help the government learn about more diverse conditions and make wiser decisions, i.e.,
“After all, I represent part of the public opinions. I feel that I am willing to cede control of my personal
information to the government if it benefits more people. I hope my information can let the government
know the needs of more people.” Although the government had stored a lot of personal information
and could do harmful things with it, P2 stated that “If the government wanted to do something
against you, the government would have done so long ago.”
Proc. ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact., Vol. 8, No. CSCW1, Article 138. Publication date: April 2024.

Personal Information Protection Law Compliance and Perceptions in China

138:15

7.3.3 False Positive Non-Compliant Activities. Interviewees missed identifying several online platform activities that were non-compliant. For example, interviewees identified the inconvenience of
revoking consent via the multiple pop-ups within online platforms that were used to obtain personal
consent, however, they did not believe that being inconvenienced was a non-compliant activity.
Instead, they regarded this non-compliant activity as simply a challenge for further improvement.
Three interviewees, regarded these practises as “rogue" and believed that online platforms utilized
them to legitimize their “harassment” of users, e.g., “I did not give the food delivery app permission
to use the camera , but the app asked me for the permission three times in a day” (P24).
As iOS devices have the option to ask an application not to track a user, some interviewees
thought this option was a by-product of online platforms trying to meet the requirements of PIPL.
Therefore, they thought that if they chose this option, platforms would not collect their data and
their search records would not appear in search engines, e.g., “I changed my phone in January this
year and I needed to download all the new software. I found a lot of pop-ups asking me to ask for no
tracking at that time, however, I think there was nothing changed. In theory, if I chose ‘No Tracking’,
I would not have my search shopping history inside Taobao” (P1). This uncertainty surrounding
the practical impact of such privacy options on online platforms underscores the need for more
transparent information and education for users regarding the actual outcomes of their choices.
Interviewees’ abilities to recognize, for example, missing details about third-party online platforms’ contact information depended on the interviewees’ level of knowledge. For example, P5,
who was concerned about third-party data sharing, exhibited no hesitation in pointing out the
cases where insufficient third-party information was provided and also listed the missing information, whereas several other interviewees who were not concerned about this did not identify this
missing data. In general, the limited knowledge and awareness of individuals, combined with a
generally high tolerance for non-compliant practices, hindered interviewees abilities to recognize
non-compliant activities.
In addition, the presentation design of privacy policies was also found to further complicate
the identification of non-compliant activities. During Task 2, interviewees received an expert of a
privacy policy and reviewed large screenshots with sparse text in them, which is more favorable
than viewing a privacy policy on a small mobile phone screen as they would do in their daily life.
All interviewees thus complained about the intolerable length of traditional privacy policies. They
also noted that the use of bold fonts was often not obvious and that this led them to skip some
core parts of privacy policies. Some interviewees also thought that some online platforms even
bolded the wrong text to mislead users and prevent them from reading important terms, e.g., “In
one article, the "real-name system" and the relevant law were highlighted, indicating their importance.
However, the same article mentioned the sharing of identity card information with other applications
owned by the same company, which I found unsuitable. Surprisingly, this particular information was
not highlighted or given similar emphasis.” (P28).

DISCUSSION

The two studies that were conducted identified the changes and implications of the invocation of
China’s PIPL. This research is not only one of the first systematic investigations of PIPL, but also
contributes to the burgeoning attention that is being devoted to the legal regulation of privacy and
personal information and illuminates the troublesome practices and perceptions of personal information protection that exist. Beyond this, our findings add to the scarce literature on non-Western
users’ privacy concerns, which can greatly advance the scholarly understanding of the influence of
cultural differences on the awareness of privacy protection and public-private boundaries.

138:16

Morgana Mo Zhou et al.

Previous research has extensively examined the compliance landscape of applications under
GDPR and identified common privacy concerns, including complex permission revocation procedures, obscure privacy language, and inadequate data handling. Building upon this body of work,
our study explores similar issues prevalent in online platforms within the Chinese context, including
inadequate consent revocation mechanisms, deficiencies in implementing the right to copy and
transfer data, and shortcomings in obtaining separate individual consent [5, 18, 34]. While some
common privacy concerns align with prior studies, our research also identified unique challenges
specific to Chinese platforms, such as the lack of risk assessment and user notification, calling for
tailored approaches to enhance privacy protection.
Our study aligns with the previous studies [52, 65], emphasizing the presence of a lack of privacy
awareness and conceptual understanding within the Chinese context. In line with the findings from
Wang et al. [65], our research affirms that Chinese users tend to be willing to share their private
data and exhibit lower concerns about potential privacy issues. This highlights a higher degree
of insensitivity towards privacy among Chinese users, leading to a greater acceptance of noncompliant activities. Furthermore, in scenarios involving the tracking of users’ online behaviors,
Chinese users display a sophisticated understanding of automated algorithms. Building upon the
findings by Wang et al. [65], our research reveals that this extensive comprehension often results
in users prioritizing convenience over personal privacy.
In the study conducted by Fife and Orjuela [20], it was emphasized that Japanese users perceive
"private" as falling within the "public" domain, whereas Chinese internet users hold a contrasting
perspective, where "private" is distinct from the "public" domain. This divergence in outlook
can be attributed to variations in their trust in the government and their altruistic beliefs. The
level of trust individuals have in the government significantly influences their perceptions of
privacy and their readiness to disclose personal information. This underscores the crucial need to
account for societal attitudes and cultural factors when formulating privacy policies in non-Western
contexts. In our research, more than half of the participants expressed a willingness to share their
information with the government or make it public. However, for some users, this willingness was
tinged with reluctance, as they felt powerless as individuals within the broader societal context.
Nevertheless, it is crucial to recognize that these privacy behaviors may not be consistent across
all Chinese users, and there can be variations in their levels of trust and willingness to share
information. People’s attitudes are intricate and multifaceted, shaped by factors beyond nationality,
encompassing elements such as ethnicity, religion, socioeconomic status, and personal experiences.
Based on these findings, there are several implications for the three stakeholders engaged in
personal information protection, i.e., lawmakers, personal information processors (i.e., online
platforms), and users.
8.1

Implications

8.1.1 Implications for Lawmakers. Our results demonstrated that PIPL still requires refinement to
maximize its effectiveness. Consequently, for lawmakers, our findings provide timely and detailed
feedback on the current state of PIPL execution, which can assist legal authorities in assessing the
design and implementation of PIPL. In particular, by making references to information about the
non-compliant activities found in the privacy policies of the thirteen online platforms, lawmakers
can clarify the regulations and strengthen the enforcement of the corresponding activit ies in a
targeted way, for example, the clarification of the scope of “other personal information processing
activities that have a significant impact on individual rights” (Article 55 [47]).
Additionally, as interviewees emphasized the importance of flexibility and adaptability in the
development of legislation, we recommend that lawmakers conduct regular user interviews and
assessments of online platform compliance (similar to our study), to determine whether online
Proc. ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact., Vol. 8, No. CSCW1, Article 138. Publication date: April 2024.

Personal Information Protection Law Compliance and Perceptions in China

138:17

platforms are properly protecting users’ privacy. Furthermore, we suggest that lawmakers engage in
more extensive research to identify areas of the PIPL that may require adjustments or strengthening,
such as emerging issues with technologies such as artificial intelligence, biometric identification,
and Internet of Things devices. By doing so, lawmakers can ensure that the PIPL is a more effective
privacy standard.
Likewise, considering the confusion caused by the inconsistent and potentially misleading use of
bold font styles, we strongly advise lawmakers to take proactive measures in creating standardized
guidelines for regulating the interface design of application privacy policies. These guidelines
should cover the proper usage of font styles, such as when to employ bold, italic, underline, and
when to utilize uppercase or lowercase letters. The overarching goal is to mitigate user confusion
and improve clarity in privacy policy presentation.
In the cultural context of China, privacy remains a relatively nascent concept. It is noteworthy
that many Chinese individuals lack an understanding of privacy, which lead to an insufficient
emphasis being placed upon its importance [65]. In line with this, our study also found limitations
in interviewees’ comprehension of PIPL and the concept of informed consent. It is thus imperative
for government authorities to increase the public’s legal education to raise the public’s awareness
of privacy protection and rectify misunderstandings about PIPL and its goals.
8.1.2 Implications for Personal Information Processors. Our study highlighted the need for personal
information processors, i.e., online platforms, to engage in more rigorous and active implementations
of PIPL and for them to develop more user-friendly privacy services to facilitate user rights
protection.
It was not uncommon to find non-compliant activities within post-PIPL privacy policies (Table 3).
Therefore, personal information processors should conduct self-assessments about the degree to
which they fulfill PIPL and correct non-compliant activities that are part of their operations. For
instance, personal information processors need to ensure proper user consent is obtained and
conduct risk assessments before sharing users’ data with other processors. Furthermore, personal
information processors should consider implementing user interface designs that alleviate user
privacy concerns and make it easy to revoke consent. Additionally, to address concerns about
background data collection, online platforms should provide users with a daily summary of collected
information, specifying the data collected throughout the day and its specific purposes.
Considering that users often have limited legal knowledge and reading through privacy policies
places a great burden on them, personal information processors should make efforts to improve
privacy policy transparency, conciseness, and clarity. One approach could be to design more
user-friendly interfaces that present privacy terms in a succinct, readable ways. Such designs
should accurately highlight the most salient aspects of the privacy policy and possibly incorporate
visual elements, where appropriate. For example, personal information processors could create
informative videos that provide clear explanations of their data collection and usage practices, as
well as inform users about their rights, similar to those found in Google’s [23], Facebook’s [42],
and the Guardian’s privacy policies [25]. This practise would improve user understanding and
engagement with privacy materials and matters.
Collaboration between personal information processors and authoritative legal institutions
would also be a valuable approach to alleviate the burdens currently placed on users to safeguard
their rights. For example, legal institutions could compile a risk advisory table for privacy policies.
The table could highlight potential non-compliant provisions and serve as a useful resource to alert
users about potential risks. Furthermore, when all provisions in a privacy policy are compliant with
the applicable regulations and standards, a legal certification could be granted, assuring users that
the personal information processor had adhered to necessary privacy practices and requirements.

8.1.3 Implications for Users. Users, who are the intended beneficiaries of PIPL, also have a crucial
role to play in promoting personal information protection. It became evident from interviewees’
misunderstandings about the right of informed consent that there is a need to enhance the public’s
awareness of personal information and users’ abilities to safeguard personal information effectively.
In light of this result, users should prioritize staying up to date on the latest privacy regulations and
best practices related to personal information protection. While it is true that privacy policies can
be dense and challenging to navigate, there are several steps users can take to overcome this hurdle.
One approach is to seek information from reputable sources that provide simplified explanations
and summaries of privacy policies. Additionally, users can actively engage in educational initiatives
and workshops that focus on privacy rights and practices. These initiatives can help users better
understand the implications of sharing personal information and how to make informed choices
when interacting with online platforms.
Furthermore, users should exercise caution when sharing personal information, particularly
on social media platforms. While being mindful of the potential risks, users should evaluate the
necessity and appropriateness of sharing sensitive details and avoid disclosing sensitive information
unless absolutely necessary. In addition, users should pay more attention to the issue of personal
information leakage in their everyday use of online platforms. For example, users need to be aware
of the permissions they grant to online platforms and regularly review their privacy settings within
social media accounts, applications, and other online platforms. By actively managing privacy
settings, users can maintain better control over their personal information. Lastly, we recommend
that users take proactive steps to build up necessary knowledge and skills in rights protection.
Users should educate themselves about privacy rights, understand how to exercise control over
their personal data, and become aware of the actions they can take to protect their privacy.
By following these suggestions, users can contribute to the promotion of personal information
protection and play an active role in safeguarding their own privacy rights.

Limitations

While we attempted to recruit a diverse interviewee pool and sample a range of online platform
privacy policies, this research does, however, have several limitations. First, the survey respondents
and interviewees in our study were only recruited through the Douban platform, which may
skew the sample toward active users of Douban. Though the gender, age, and educational level
distribution of the sample was reasonably balanced, it was still limited in its representativeness
of Chinese Internet users. In the future, a more inclusive recruitment strategy should be used
to strengthen the diversity of the selected sample. Additionally, this research mainly examined
Chinese Internet users’ perceptions of PIPL and the right of informed consent. Given that the
implementation of PIPL is an ongoing process, privacy policies constantly change, and users’
mindsets and perceptions evolve over time, future longitudinal research is needed to monitor any
changes that occur and track long-term trends that emerge.

CONCLUSION

This research used a two-pronged approach to understand the effects of invoking PIPL in China on
users and online platforms. In Study 1, a review of the privacy policies of 13 prominent platforms
was conducted to identify any changes that occurred post-PIPL invocation. The findings revealed
that the privacy policies generally became more user-friendly and employed simpler language
and logical structures. Platforms also demonstrated an increased obligation to inform users and
provide stronger individual rights protection. During the evaluation, we identified four instances of
non-compliant activities, including not having a prior personal information risk assessment when
handling sensitive data and the failure to obtain separate consent from users.

Personal Information Protection Law Compliance and Perceptions in China

138:19

In Study 2, we examined the perceptions of 30 Chinese Internet users regarding PIPL. Interviewees
exhibited a high level of awareness regarding PIPL, with a basic understanding of its purpose and
fundamental principles. Furthermore, we identified factors that influenced interviewees’ attitudes
towards PIPL, including the interface designs that were used and the vague language contained
within PIPL. We also evaluated interviewees’ ability to recognize non-compliant activities, finding
that while interviewees were generally able to identify obvious non-compliant activities such as
app eavesdropping and excessive data collection, they struggled with recognizing activities related
to obtaining separate consent. Interviewees’ difficulties in identifying non-compliant activities
were attributed to factors such as their trust in the government, which lead to them having a higher
tolerance for non-compliant behaviors.
Lawmakers, personal information processors, users, and future researchers should be able to
draw on our findings and implications to improve personal information practices in China and
potentially worldwide.
