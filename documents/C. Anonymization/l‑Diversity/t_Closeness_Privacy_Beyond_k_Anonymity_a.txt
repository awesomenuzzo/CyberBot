Abstract
The k-anonymity privacy requirement for publishing microdata requires that each equivalence class (i.e., a set of
records that are indistinguishable from each other with respect to certain “identifying” attributes) contains at least
k records. Recently, several authors have recognized that
k-anonymity cannot prevent attribute disclosure. The notion of ℓ-diversity has been proposed to address this; ℓdiversity requires that each equivalence class has at least
ℓ well-represented values for each sensitive attribute.
In this paper we show that ℓ-diversity has a number of
limitations. In particular, it is neither necessary nor sufficient to prevent attribute disclosure. We propose a novel
privacy notion called t-closeness, which requires that the
distribution of a sensitive attribute in any equivalence class
is close to the distribution of the attribute in the overall table (i.e., the distance between the two distributions should
be no more than a threshold t). We choose to use the Earth
Mover Distance measure for our t-closeness requirement.
We discuss the rationale for t-closeness and illustrate its
advantages through examples and experiments.

1. Introduction
Agencies and other organizations often need to publish
microdata, e.g., medical data or census data, for research
and other purposes. Typically, such data is stored in a table,
and each record (row) corresponds to one individual. Each
record has a number of attributes, which can be divided into
the following three categories. (1) Attributes that clearly
identify individuals. These are known as explicit identifiers
and include Social Security Number, Address, and Name,
and so on. (2) Attributes whose values when taken together
can potentially identify an individual. These are known as
quasi-identifiers, and may include, e.g., Zip-code, Birthdate, and Gender. (3) Attributes that are considered sensitive, such as Disease and Salary.
When releasing microdata, it is necessary to prevent
the sensitive information of the individuals from being dis-

closed. Two types of information disclosure have been identified in the literature [4, 9]: identity disclosure and attribute
disclosure. Identity disclosure occurs when an individual is
linked to a particular record in the released table. Attribute
disclosure occurs when new information about some individuals is revealed, i.e., the released data makes it possible
to infer the characteristics of an individual more accurately
than it would be possible before the data release. Identity
disclosure often leads to attribute disclosure. Once there
is identity disclosure, an individual is re-identified and the
corresponding sensitive values are revealed. Attribute disclosure can occur with or without identity disclosure. It has
been recognized that even disclosure of false attribute information may cause harm [9]. An observer of a released
table may incorrectly perceive that an individual’s sensitive
attribute takes a particular value, and behave accordingly
based on the perception. This can harm the individual, even
if the perception is incorrect.
While the released table gives useful information to
researchers, it presents disclosure risk to the individuals
whose data are in the table. Therefore, our objective is to
limit the disclosure risk to an acceptable level while maximizing the benefit. This is achieved by anonymizing the
data before release. The first step of anonymization is to remove explicit identifiers. However, this is not enough, as an
adversary may already know the quasi-identifier values of
some individuals in the table. This knowledge can be either
from personal knowledge (e.g., knowing a particular individual in person), or from other publicly-available databases
(e.g., a voter registration list) that include both explicit
identifiers and quasi-identifiers. A common anonymization
approach is generalization, which replaces quasi-identifier
values with values that are less-specific but semantically
consistent. As a result, more records will have the same set
of quasi-identifier values. We define an equivalence class
of an anonymized table to be a set of records that have the
same values for the quasi-identifiers.
To effectively limit disclosure, we need to measure the
disclosure risk of an anonymized table. To this end, Samarati and Sweeney [15, 16, 18] introduced k-anonymity as
the property that each record is indistinguishable with at

least k-1 other records with respect to the quasi-identifier.
In other words, k-anonymity requires that each equivalence
class contains at least k records.
While k-anonymity protects against identity disclosure,
it is insufficient to prevent attribute disclosure. To address this limitation of k-anonymity, Machanavajjhala et
al. [12] recently introduced a new notion of privacy, called
ℓ-diversity, which requires that the distribution of a sensitive attribute in each equivalence class has at least ℓ “wellrepresented” values.
One problem with l-diversity is that it is limited in its
assumption of adversarial knowledge. As we shall explain
below, it is possible for an adversary to gain information
about a sensitive attribute as long as she has information
about the global distribution of this attribute. This assumption generalizes the specific background and homogeneity
attacks used to motivate ℓ-diversity. Another problem with
privacy-preserving methods in general is that they effectively assume all attributes to be categorical; the adversary
either does or does not learn something sensitive. Of course,
especially with numerical attributes, being close to the value
is often good enough.
We propose a novel privacy notion called t-closeness that
formalizes the idea of global background knowledge by requiring that the distribution of a sensitive attribute in any
equivalence class is close to the distribution of the attribute
in the overall table (i.e., the distance between the two distributions should be no more than a threshold t). This effectively limits the amount of individual-specific information an observer can learn. Further, in order to incorporate
distances between values of sensitive attributes, we use the
Earth Mover Distance metric [14] to measure the distance
between the two distributions. We discuss the rationale for
t-closeness and illustrate its advantages through examples
and experiments.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We give
an overview of ℓ-diversity in Section 2 and discuss its limitations in Section 3. We present the rationale and definition
of t-closeness in Section 4, and discuss how to calculate
the Earth Mover Distance in Section 5. Experimental results are presented in Section 6. Related work is discussed
in Section 7. In Section 8, we discuss limitations of our
approach and avenues for future research.

2. From k-Anonymity to ℓ-Diversity
The protection k-anonymity provides is simple and easy
to understand. If a table satisfies k-anonymity for some
value k, then anyone who knows only the quasi-identifier
values of one individual cannot identify the record corresponding to that individual with confidence grater than 1/k.
While k-anonymity protects against identity disclosure,
it does not provide sufficient protection against attribute

disclosure. This has been recognized by several authors,
e.g., [12, 19, 21]. Two attacks were identified in [12]: the
homogeneity attack and the background knowledge attack.
Example 1 Table 1 is the original data table, and Table 2 is
an anonymized version of it satisfying 3-anonymity. The
Disease attribute is sensitive. Suppose Alice knows that
Bob is a 27-year old man living in ZIP 47678 and Bob’s
record is in the table. From Table 2, Alice can conclude that
Bob corresponds to one of the first three records, and thus
must have heart disease. This is the homogeneity attack.
For an example of the background knowledge attack, suppose that, by knowing Carl’s age and zip code, Alice can
conclude that Carl corresponds to a record in the last equivalence class in Table 2. Furthermore, suppose that Alice
knows that Carl has very low risk for heart disease. This
background knowledge enables Alice to conclude that Carl
most likely has cancer.
To address these limitations of k-anonymity,
Machanavajjhala et al. [12] introduced ℓ-diversity as a
stronger notion of privacy.
Deﬁnition 1 (The ℓ-diversity Principle) An equivalence
class is said to have ℓ-diversity if there are at least ℓ
“well-represented” values for the sensitive attribute. A
table is said to have ℓ-diversity if every equivalence class
of the table has ℓ-diversity.

Machanavajjhala et al. [12] gave a number of interpretations of the term “well-represented” in this principle:
1. Distinct ℓ-diversity. The simplest understanding of
“well represented” would be to ensure there are at
least ℓ distinct values for the sensitive attribute in each
equivalence class. Distinct ℓ-diversity does not prevent
probabilistic inference attacks. An equivalence class
may have one value appear much more frequently than
other values, enabling an adversary to conclude that an
entity in the equivalence class is very likely to have
that value. This motivated the development of the following two stronger notions of ℓ-diversity.
2. Entropy ℓ-diversity. The entropy of an equivalence
class E is defined to be

p(E, s) log p(E, s)
Entropy(E) = −
s∈S

in which S is the domain of the sensitive attribute, and
p(E, s) is the fraction of records in E that have sensitive value s.
A table is said to have entropy ℓ-diversity if for every
equivalence class E, Entropy(E) ≥ log ℓ. Entropy ℓdiversity is strong than distinct ℓ-diversity. As pointed
out in [12], in order to have entropy ℓ-diversity for each
equivalence class, the entropy of the entire table must
be at least log(ℓ). Sometimes this may too restrictive,
as the entropy of the entire table may be low if a few
values are very common. This leads to the following
less conservative notion of ℓ-diversity.
3. Recursive (c, ℓ)-diversity. Recursive (c, ℓ)-diversity
makes sure that the most frequent value does not appear too frequently, and the less frequent values do not
appear too rarely. Let m be the number of values in an
equivalence class, and ri , 1 ≤ i ≤ m be the number of
times that the ith most frequent sensitive value appears
in an equivalence class E. Then E is said to have recursive (c, ℓ)-diversity if r1 < c(rl + rl+1 + ... + rm ).
A table is said to have recursive (c, ℓ)-diversity if all of
its equivalence classes have recursive (c, ℓ)-diversity.

3. Limitations of ℓ-Diversity
While the ℓ-diversity principle represents an important
step beyond k-anonymity in protecting against attribute disclosure, it has several shortcomings that we now discuss.
ℓ-diversity may be difﬁcult and unnecessary to achieve.
Example 2 Suppose that the original data has only one sensitive attribute: the test result for a particular virus. It takes
two values: positive and negative. Further suppose that

1-4244-0803-2/07/$20.00 ©2007 IEEE.

there are 10000 records, with 99% of them being negative,
and only 1% being positive. Then the two values have very
different degrees of sensitivity. One would not mind being known to be tested negative, because then one is the
same as 99% of the population, but one would not want
to be known/considered to be tested positive. In this case,
2-diversity is unnecessary for an equivalence class that contains only records that are negative. In order to have a distinct 2-diverse table, there can be at most 10000×1% = 100
equivalence classes and the information loss would be large.
Also observe that because the entropy of the sensitive attribute in the overall table is very small, if one uses entropy
ℓ-diversity, ℓ must be set to a small value.
ℓ-diversity is insufﬁcient to prevent attribute disclosure.
Below we present two attacks on ℓ-diversity.
Skewness Attack: When the overall distribution is
skewed, satisfying ℓ-diversity does not prevent attribute disclosure. Consider again Example 2. Suppose that one
equivalence class has an equal number of positive records
and negative records. It satisfies distinct 2-diversity, entropy
2-diversity, and any recursive (c, 2)-diversity requirement
that can be imposed. However, this presents a serious privacy risk, because anyone in the class would be considered
to have 50% possibility of being positive, as compared with
the 1% of the overall population.
Now consider an equivalence class that has 49 positive
records and only 1 negative record. It would be distinct 2diverse and has higher entropy than the overall table (and
thus satisfies any Entropy ℓ-diversity that one can impose),
even though anyone in the equivalence class would be considered 98% positive, rather than 1% percent. In fact, this
equivalence class has exactly the same diversity as a class
that has 1 positive and 49 negative records, even though the
two classes present very differen levels of privacy risks.
Similarity Attack: When the sensitive attribute values in
an equivalence class are distinct but semantically similar,
an adversary can learn important information. Consider the
following example.
Example 3 Table 3 is the original table, and Table 4 shows
an anonymized version satisfying distinct and entropy 3diversity. There are two sensitive attributes: Salary and Disease. Suppose one knows that Bob’s record corresponds to
one of the first three records, then one knows that Bob’s
salary is in the range [3K–5K] and can infer that Bob’s
salary is relatively low. This attack applies not only to
numeric attributes like “Salary”, but also to categorical attributes like “Disease”. Knowing that Bob’s record belongs
to the first equivalence class enables one to conclude that
Bob has some stomach-related problems, because all three
diseases in the class are stomach-related.

Table 4. A 3-diverse version of Table 3
This leakage of sensitive information occurs because
while ℓ-diversity requirement ensures “diversity” of sensitive values in each group, it does not take into account the
semantical closeness of these values.
Summary In short, distributions that have the same level
of diversity may provide very different levels of privacy, because there are semantic relationships among the attribute
values, because different values have very different levels
of sensitivity, and because privacy is also affected by the
relationship with the overall distribution.

4. t-Closeness: A New Privacy Measure
Intuitively, privacy is measured by the information gain
of an observer. Before seeing the released table, the observer has some prior belief about the sensitive attribute
value of an individual. After seeing the released table, the
observer has a posterior belief. Information gain can be represented as the difference between the posterior belief and
the prior belief. The novelty of our approach is that we
separate the information gain into two parts: that about the
whole population in the released data and that about specific
individuals.
To motivate our approach, let us perform the following
thought experiment: First an observer has some prior belief B0 about an individual’s sensitive attribute. Then, in a

1-4244-0803-2/07/$20.00 ©2007 IEEE.

hypothetical step, the observer is given a completely generalized version of the data table where all attributes in a
quasi-identifier are removed (or, equivalently, generalized
to the most general values). The observer’s belief is influenced by Q, the distribution of the sensitive attribute value
in the whole table, and changes to B1 . Finally, the observer
is given the released table. By knowing the quasi-identifier
values of the individual, the observer is able to identify the
equivalence class that the individual’s record is in, and learn
the distribution P of sensitive attribute values in this class.
The observer’s belief changes to B2 .
The ℓ-diversity requirement is motivated by limiting the
difference between B0 and B2 (although it does so only indirectly, by requiring that P has a level of diversity). We
choose to limit the difference between B1 and B2 . In other
words, we assume that Q, the distribution of the sensitive
attribute in the overall population in the table, is public information. We do not limit the observer’s information gain
about the population as a whole, but limit the extent to
which the observer can learn additional information about
specific individuals.
To justify our assumption that Q should be treated as
public information, we observe that with generalizations,
the most one can do is to generalize all quasi-identifier attributes to the most general value. Thus as long as a version of the data is to be released, a distribution Q will be
released.1 We also argue that if one wants to release the
table at all, one intends to release the distribution Q and
this distribution is what makes data in this table useful. In
other words, one wants Q to be public information. A large
change from B0 to B1 means that the data table contains
a lot of new information, e.g., the new data table corrects
some widely held belief that was wrong. In some sense, the
larger the difference between B0 and B1 is, the more valuable the data is. Since the knowledge gain between B0 and
B1 is about the whole population, we do not limit this gain.
We limit the gain from B1 to B2 by limiting the distance
between P and Q. Intuitively, if P = Q, then B1 and B2
should be the same. If P and Q are close, then B1 and B2
should be close as well, even if B0 may be very different
from both B1 and B2 .
Deﬁnition 2 (The t-closeness Principle:) An equivalence
class is said to have t-closeness if the distance between the
distribution of a sensitive attribute in this class and the distribution of the attribute in the whole table is no more than
a threshold t. A table is said to have t-closeness if all equivalence classes have t-closeness.
1 Note that even with suppression, a distribution will still be released.
This distribution may be slightly different from the distribution with no
record suppressed; however, from our point of view, we only need to consider the released distribution and the distance of it from the ones in the
equivalence classes.

Of course, requiring that P and Q to be close would also
limit the amount of useful information that is released, as
it limits information about the correlation between quasiidentifier attributes and sensitive attributes. However, this
is precisely what one needs to limit. If an observer gets too
clear a picture of this correlation, then attribute disclosure
occurs. The t parameter in t-closeness enables one to trade
off between utility and privacy.
Now the problem is to measure the distance between two
probabilistic distributions. There are a number of ways to
define the distance between them. Given two distributions
P = (p1 , p2 , ..., pm ), Q = (q1 , q2 , ..., qm ), two well-known
distance measures are as follows. The variational distance
is defined as:
D[P, Q] =

m

the other as a collection of holes in the same space. EMD
measures the least amount of work needed to fill the holes
with earth. A unit of work corresponds to moving a unit of
earth by a unit of ground distance.
EMD can be formally defined using the well-studied
transportation problem. Let P = (p1 , p2 , ...pm ), Q =
(q1 , q2 , ...qm ), and dij be the ground distance between element i of P and element j of Q. We want to find a flow
F = [fij ] where fij is the flow of mass from element i of
P to element j of Q that minimizes the overall work:
WORK (P, Q, F ) =

m 

subject to the following constraints:
|pi − qi |.
fij ≥ 0

And the Kullback-Leibler (KL) distance [8] is defined as:
pi

D[P, Q] =

where H(P) 
=
i=1 pi log pi is the entropy of P and
m
p
H(P, Q) =
i=1 i log qi is the cross-entropy of P and
Q.
These distance measures do not reflect the semantic distance among values. Recall Example 3 (Tables 3 and 4),
where the overall distribution of the Income attribute is Q =
{3k, 4k, 5k, 6k, 7k, 8k, 9k, 10k, 11k}.2 The first equivalence class in Table 4 has distribution P1 = {3k, 4k, 5k}
and the second equivalence class has distribution P2 =
{6k, 8k, 11k}. Our intuition is that P1 results in more information leakage than P2 , because the values in P1 are all
in the lower end; thus we would like to have D[P1 , Q] >
D[P2 , Q]. The distance measures mentioned above would
not be able to do so, because from their point of view values
such as 3k and 6k are just different points and have no other
semantic meaning.
In short, we have a metric space for the attribute values
so that a ground distance is defined between any pair of values. We then have two probability distributions over these
values and we want the distance between the two probability distributions to be dependent upon the ground distances
among these values. This requirement leads us to the the
Earth Mover’s distance (EMD) [14], which is actually a
Monge-Kantorovich transportation distance [5] in disguise.
The EMD is based on the minimal amount of work
needed to transform one distribution to another by moving
distribution mass between each other. Intuitively, one distribution is seen as a mass of earth spread in the space and

These three constraints guarantee that P is transformed

We will discuss how to calculate the EMD between two
distributions in Section 5. We now observe two useful facts
about EMD.
Fact 1 If 0 ≤ dij ≤ 1 for all i, j, then 0 ≤ D[P, Q] ≤ 1.
The above fact follows directly from constraint (c1) and
(c3). It says that if the ground distances are normalized, i.e.,
all distances are between 0 and 1, then the EMD between
any two distributions is between 0 and 1. This gives a range
from which one can choose the t value for t-closeness.
Fact 2 Given two equivalence classes E1 and E2 , let P1 ,
P2 , and P be the distribution of a sensitive attribute in E1 ,
E2 , and E1 ∪ E2 , respectively. Then
D[P, Q] ≤

|E2 |
|E1 |
D[P1 , Q] +
D[P2 , Q]
|E1 | + |E2 |
|E1 | + |E2 |

3 More generally, the EMD is the total work divided by the total flow.
However, since we are calculating distance between two probability distributions, the total flow is always 1, as shown in formula (c3).

It follows that D[P, Q] ≤ max(D[P1 , Q], D[P2 , Q]). This
means that when merging two equivalence classes, the maximum distance of any equivalence class from the overall distribution can never increase. Thus t-closeness is achievable
for any t ≥ 0.
The above fact entails that t-closeness with EMD satisfies the following two properties.
Generalization Property Let T be a table, and let A
and B be two generalizations on T such that A is more
general than B If T satisfies t-closeness using B, then T
also satisfies t-closeness using A.
Proof Since each equivalence class in A is the union of
a set of equivalence classes in B and each equivalence class
in B satisfies t-closeness, we conclude that each equivalence class in A also satisfies t-closeness. Thus T satisfies
t-closeness using A.
Subset Property Let T be a table and let C be a set of
attributes in T . If T satisfies t-closeness with respect to C,
then T also satisfies t-closeness with respect to any set of
attributes D such that D ⊂ C.
Proof Similarly, each equivalence class with respect to
D is the union of a set of equivalence classes with respect
to C and each equivalence class with respect to C satisfies
t-closeness, we conclude that each equivalence class with
respect to D also satisfies t-closeness. Thus T satisfies tcloseness with respect to D.
The two properties guarantee that the t-closeness using
EMD measurement can be incorporated into the general
framework of the Incognito algorithm [10].

5. How to Calculate the EMD
To use t-closeness with EMD, we need to be able to calculate the EMD between two distributions. One can calculate EMD using solutions to the transportation problem,
such as a min-cost flow[1]; however, these algorithms do
not provide an explicit formula. In the rest of this section, we derive formulas for calculating EMD for the special
cases that we need to consider.

5.1. EMD for Numerical Attributes
Numerical attribute values are ordered. Let the attribute
domain be {v1 , v2 ...vm }, where vi is the ith smallest value.
Ordered Distance: The distance between two values of
is based on the number of values between them in the total
order, i.e., ordered dist(vi , vj ) = |i−j|
m−1 .
It is straightforward to verify that the ordered-distance
measure is a metric. It is non-negative and satisfies the
symmetry property and the triangle inequality. To calculate EMD under ordered distance, we only need to consider
flows that transport distribution mass between adjacent elements, because any transportation between two more dis-

tant elements can be equivalently decomposed into several
transportations between adjacent elements. Based on this
observation, minimal work can be achieved by satisfying
all elements of Q sequentially. We first consider element
1, which has an extra amount of p1 − q1 . Assume, without
loss of generality, that p1 − q1 < 0, an amount of q1 − p1
should be transported from other elements to element 1. We
can transport this from element 2. After this transportation,
element 1 is satisfied and element 2 has an extra amount of
(p1 −q1 )+(p2 −q2 ). Similarly, we can satisfy element 2 by
transporting an amount of |(p1 − q1 ) + (p2 − q2 )| between
element 2 and element 3. This process continues until element m is satisfied and Q is reached.
Formally, let ri = pi − qi ,(i=1,2,...,m), then the distance
between P and Q can be calculated as:

5.2. EMD for Categorical Attributes

For categorical attributes, a total order often does not exist. We consider two distance measures.
Equal Distance: The ground distance between any two
value of a categorical attribute is defined to be 1. It is easy
to verify that this is a metric. As the distance between any
two values is 1, for each point that pi − qi > 0, one just
needs to move the extra to some other points. Thus we have
the following formula:
D[P, Q] =

m

(pi −qi )
|pi −qi | =
(pi −qi ) = −
2 i=1
p <q

Hierarchical Distance: The distance between two values of a categorical attribute is based on the minimum level
to which these two values are generalized to the same value
according to the domain hierarchy. Mathematically, let H
be the height of the domain hierarchy, the distance between
two values v1 and v2 (which are leaves of the hierarchy) is
defined to be level (v1 , v2 )/H, where level(v1 , v2 ) is the
height of the lowest common ancestor node of v1 and v2 .
It is straightforward to verify that this hierarchical-distance
measure is also a metric.
Given a domain hierarchy and two distributions P and
Q, we define the extra of a leaf node that corresponds to
element i, to be pi − qi , and the extra of an internal node N
to be the sum of extras of leaf nodes below N . This extra
function can be defined recursively as:

if N is a leaf
pi − qi

extra(N ) =
extra(C)
otherwise
C∈Child(N )

where Child(N ) is the set of all leaf nodes below node N .
The extra function has the property that the sum of extra
values for nodes at the same level is 0.
We further define two other functions for internal nodes:

|extra(C)|
pos extra(N ) =

1

C∈Child(N )∧extra(C)>0

neg extra(N )

=



|extra(C)|

C∈Child(N )∧extra(C)<0

We use cost(N ) to denote the cost of movings between N ’s children branches. An optimal flow moves exactly extra(N ) in/out of the subtree rooted at N . Suppose that pos extra(N ) > neg extra, then extra(N ) =
pos extra(N ) − neg extra(N ) and extra(N ) needs to
move out. (This cost is counted in the cost of N ’s parent
node.) In addition, one has to move neg extra among the
children nodes to even out all children branches; thus,
cost(N ) =

height(N )
min(pos extra(N ), neg extra(N ))
H

Then the earth mover’s distance can be written as:

D[P, Q] = N cost(N )

where N is a non-leaf node.

Bob has stomach-related diseases based on Table 5.
We note that t-closeness protects against attribute disclosure, but does not deal with identity disclosure. Thus, it may
be desirable to use both t-closeness and k-anonymity at the
same time. Further, it should be noted that t-closeness deals
with the homogeneity and background knowledge attacks
on k-anonymity not by guaranteeing that they can never occur, but by guaranteeing that if such attacks can occur, then
similar attacks can occur even with a fully-generalized table. As we argued earlier, this is the best one can achieve if
one is to release the data at all.

Analysis of t-Closeness with EMD

6. Experiments
We now revisit Example 3 in Section 3, to show how tcloseness with EMD handles the difficulties of ℓ-diversity.
Recall that Q = {3k, 4k, 5k, 6k, 7k, 8k, 9k, 10k, 11k},
P1 = {3k, 4k, 5k}, and P2 = {6k, 8k, 11k}. We calculate
D[P1 , Q] and D[P2 , Q] using EMD. Let v1 = 3k, v2 =
4k, ...v9 = 11k, we define the distance between vi and vj
to be |i − j|/8, thus the maximal distance is 1. We have
D[P1 , Q] = 0.375,4 and D[P2 , Q] = 0.167.
For the disease attribute, we use the hierarchy in Figure 1 to define the ground distances. For example, the distance between “Flu” and “Bronchitis” is 1/3, the distance
between “Flu”and “Pulmonary embolism” is 2/3, and the
distance between “Flu” and “Stomach cancer” is 3/3 = 1.
Then the distance between the distribution {gastric ulcer,
gastritis, stomach cancer} and the overall distribution is 0.5
while the distance between the distribution {gastric ulcer,
stomach cancer, pneumonia} is 0.278.
Table 5 shows another anonymized version of Table 3. It
has 0.167-closeness w.r.t Salary and 0.278-closeness w.r.t.

1 to Q is to move 1/9 probability mass across the following pairs: (5k→11k), (5k→10k), (5k→9k),
(4k→8k), (4k→7k), (4k→6k), (3k→5k), (3k→4k). The cost of this is
1/9 × (6 + 5 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1)/8 = 27/72 = 3/8 = 0.375.

The main goals of the experiments are to study the effect
of Similarity Attack on real data and to investigate the performance implications of the t-closeness approach in terms
of efficiency and data quality.
The dataset used in the experiments is the adult dataset
from the UC Irvine machine learning repository, which is
comprised of data collected from the US census. We used
nine attributes of the dataset, as shown in Figure 2. Records
with missing values are eliminated and there are 30162 valid
records in total. We use our Java implementation of the
Incognito [10] algorithm. The experiments are run on a
3.4GHZ Pentium 4 machine with 2GB memory.
Similarity Attack We use the first 7 attributes as the quasiidentifier and treat Occupation as the sensitive attribute. We
divide the 14 values of the Occupation attribute into three
roughly equal-size groups, based on the semantic closeness
of the values. Any equivalence class that has all values
falling in one group is viewed as vulnerable to the similarity
attack. We use Incognito to generate all entropy 2-diversity
tables. In total, there are 21 minimal tables and 13 of them
suffers from the Similarity attack. In one table, a total of 916
records can be inferred about their sensitive value class. We

also generate all 26 minimal recursive (4, 4)-diversity tables, and found that 17 of which are vulnerable to the similarity attack.
Efﬁciency We compare the efficiency and data quality
of five privacy measures: (1) k-anonymity; (2) entropy
ℓ-diversity; (3) recursive (c, ℓ) diversity; (4) k-anonymity
with t-closeness(t = 0.2); and (5) k-anonymity with tcloseness(t = 0.15).
Results of efficiency experiments are shown in Figure 3.
Again we use the Occupation attribute as the sensitive attribute. Figure 3(a) shows the running times with fixed
k = 5, ℓ = 5 and varied quasi-identifier size s, where
2 ≤ s ≤ 7. A quasi-identifier of size s consists of the
first s attributes listed in Table 2. Figure 3(b) shows the
running times of the five privacy measures with the same
quasi-identifier but with different parameters for k and ℓ.
As shown in the figures, entropy ℓ-diversity run faster than
the other four measures; the difference gets larger when ℓ
increases. This is because with large ℓ, entropy ℓ-diversity
prunes the search lattice earlier.
Data Quality Our third set of experiments compare the
data quality of the five privacy measures using the discernibility metric [2] and Minimal Average Group Size [10, 15].

1-4244-0803-2/07/$20.00 ©2007 IEEE.

The first metric measures the number of records that are
indistinguishable from each other. Each record in an equivalence class of size t gets a penalty of t while each suppressed tuple gets a penalty equal to the total number of
records. The second metric is the average size of the equivalence classes generated by the anonymization algorithm.
We use the 7 regular attributes as the quasi-identifier and
Occupation as the sensitive attribute. We set different parameters for k, ℓ, and compare the resulted dataset produced by different measurements. Figure 4 summarizes
the results. We found that entropy ℓ-diversity tables has
worse data quality than the other measurements. We also
found that the data quality of k-anonymous tables without tcloseness is slightly better than k-anonymous tables with tcloseness. This is because t-closeness requirement provides
extra protection to sensitive values and the cost is decreased
data quality. When choosing t = 0.2, the degradation in
data quality is minimal.

7. Related Work
The problem of information disclosure has been studied extensively in the framework of statistical databases. A
number of information disclosure limitation techniques [3]
have been designed for data publishing, including Sampling, Cell Suppression, Rounding, and Data Swapping and
Perturbation. These techniques, however, compromised
data integrity of the tables. Samarati and Sweeney [15, 16,
18] introduced the k-anonymity approach and used generalization and suppression techniques to preserve information
truthfulness. Numerous algorithms [2, 6, 11, 10, 16, 17]
have been proposed to achieve k-anonymity requirement.
Optimal k-anonymity has been proved to be NP-hard for
k ≥ 3 [13].
Recently, a number of authors have recognized that kanonymity does not prevent attribute disclosure, e.g., [12,
19, 21]. Machanavajjhala et al. [12] proposed ℓ-diversity.
As we discuss in detail in Section 3, while ℓ-diversity is
an important step beyond k-anonymity, it has a number of
limitations. Xiao and Tao [21] observe that ℓ-diversity can-

not prevent attribute disclosure, when multiple records in
the table corresponds to one individual. They proposed to
have each individual specify privacy policies about his or
her own attributes. We identify limitations of ℓ-diversity
even when each record corresponds to one individual and
proposes t-closeness, an alternative privacy measure without the need for individual policies. Xiao and Tao [20]
proposed Anatomy, an data anonymization approach that
divides one table into two for release; one table includes
original quasi-identifier and a group id, and the other include the association between the group id and the sensitive
attribute values. Anatomy uses ℓ-diversity as the privacy
measure; we believe that t-closeness can be used to provide
more meaningful privacy.

In the current proceedings, Koudas et al. [7] examine
the anonymization problem from the perspective of answering downstream aggregate queries. They develop a
new privacy-preserving framework based not on generalization, but on permutations. Their work, like ours, addresses
the problem of dealing with attributes defined on a metric
space; their approach is to lower bound the range of values
of a sensitive attribute in a group.

8. Conclusions and Future Work
While k-anonymity protects against identity disclosure,
it does not provide sufficient protection against attribute disclosure. The notion of ℓ-diversity attempts to solve this
problem by requiring that each equivalence class has at least
ℓ well-represented values for each sensitive attribute. We
have shown that ℓ-diversity has a number of limitations and
have proposed a novel privacy notion called t-closeness,
which requires that the distribution of a sensitive attribute
in any equivalence class is close to the distribution of the
attribute in the overall table (i.e., the distance between the
two distributions should be no more than a threshold t). One
key novelty of our approach is that we separate the information gain an observer can get from a released data table into two parts: that about all population in the released
data and that about specific individuals. This enables us to
limit only the second kind of information gain. We use the
Earth Mover Distance measure for our t-closeness requirement; this has the advantage of taking into consideration the
semantic closeness of attribute values. Below we discuss
some interesting open research issues.
Multiple Sensitive Attributes Multiple sensitive attributes

present additional challenges. Suppose we have two sensitive attributes U and V . One can consider the two attributes
separately, i.e., an equivalence class E has t-closeness if
E has t-closeness with respect to both U and V . Another
approach is to consider the joint distribution of the two attributes. To use this approach, one has to choose the ground
distance between pairs of sensitive attribute values. A simple formula for calculating EMD may be difficult to derive,
and the relationship between t and the level of privacy becomes more complicated.
Other Anonymization Techniques t-closeness allows
us to take advantage of anonymization techniques other
than generalization of quasi-identifier and suppression of
records. For example, instead of suppressing a whole
record, one can hide some sensitive attributes of the
record; one advantage is that the number of records in the
anonymized table is accurate, which may be useful in some
applications. Because this technique does not affect quasiidentifiers, it does not help achieve k-anonymity and hence
has not been considered before. Removing a value only
decreases diversity; therefore, it does not help to achieve
ℓ-diversity. However, in t-closeness, removing an outlier
may smooth a distribution and bring it closer to the overall distribution. Another possible technique is to generalize
a sensitive attribute value, rather than hiding it completely.
An interesting question is how to effectively combine these
techniques with generalization and suppression to achieve
better data quality.
Limitations of using EMD in t-closeness The t-closeness
principle can be applied using other distance measures.
While EMD is the best measure we have found so far, it
is certainly not perfect. In particular, the relationship between the value t and information gain is unclear. For example, the EMD between the two distributions (0.01, 0.99)
and (0.11, 0.89) is 0.1, and the EMD between (0.4, 0.6)
and (0.5, 0.5) is also 0.1. However, one may argue that the
change between the first pair is much more significant than
that between the second pair. In the first pair, the probability of taking the first value increases from 0.01 to 0.11, a
1000% increase. While in the second pair, the probability
increase is only 25%. In general, what we need is a measure that combines the distance-estimation properties of the
EMD with the probability scaling nature of the KL distance.
