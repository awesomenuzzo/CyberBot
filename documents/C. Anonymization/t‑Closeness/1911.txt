Abstract

As an example, original and anonymized tables relating to
incidents that have occurred at different homes in a city are
presented in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. The explicit identifier Address of Table 1 has been completely removed from the
anonymized data of Table 2, while the quasi-identifier Zone
and sensitive (categorical) attribute Incident have been preserved. The individual records of Table 2 are further grouped
into equivalence classes, subsets of (indistinguishable) records
having the same QI values [1, 6]. There are four such equivalence classes in Table 2. Although “anonymized”, Table 2
still reveals much to an observer. A prospective home buyer
would know for instance that homes in zone 2C experience
frequent power outrages, a finding that might discourage that
buyer from purchasing a house in that area. An insurance
provider looking at this data might be wary of insuring customers in zone 4F, given the serious events that have taken
place in that zone. By comparison, potential buyers or insurers would be more open to the homes and occupants of zone
3B, an area with comparatively minor problems.

This paper presents a tutorial of the computation of tcloseness. An established model in the domain of privacy preserving data publishing, t-closeness is a measure of the earth
mover’s distance between two distributions of an anonymized
database table. This tutorial includes three examples that
showcase the full computation of t-closeness in terms of both
numerical and categorical attributes. Calculations are carried out using the definition of the earth mover’s distance and
weighted order distance. This paper includes detailed explanations and calculations not found elsewhere in the literature.
An efficient algorithm to calculate the t-closeness of a table is
also presented.

Database tables are routinely published online. In many instances, this can be readily done without any adverse effects. At times though tables contain sensitive information that
should not be disclosed to the public. Attributes with values
that directly identify a person or entity, such as name, student ID number, or product code, are explicit identifers and
are not generally made public [1, 2]. A set of attributes that
together (and indirectly) identifies a person or entity, such as
occupation, nationality, and neighborhood, is a quasi-identifier
(QI) [1, 2]. Finally, an attribute with values that should not be
linked to a person or entity for privacy reasons, such as an employee’s salary, a patient’s medical condition, or a student’s
grade, is a sensitive attribute [3]. Before publishing a table
that contains sensitive information, certain values are either removed or obfuscated, a process known as anonymization [4].

This is done in order to prevent a subsequent user from linking
a person or entity to a sensitive value in that table. The study

Li et al. introduce t-closeness so as to overcome the problems that affect both k-anonymity and `-diversity [1, 2]. Conceptually, t-closeness is the maximum of the distances between the distribution of values of a sensitive attribute of the
equivalence classes (of a table) and that of the (entire) table.
The intuition is that individual equivalence classes of a table
that are similar to that table do not generally reveal any more
information than the table itself. Formally, “an equivalence
class is said to have t-closeness if the distance between the
distribution of a sensitive attribute in this class and the distribution of the attribute in the whole table is no more than a
threshold t. A table is said to have t-closeness if all equivalence classes have t-closeness” [1]. At this point, no universal threshold for t appears to exist. The computation of the
t-closeness of Table 2 is deferred to Section 2.2.
This paper provides a comprehensive tutorial of the calculation of the t-closeness model in situations involving either
a numerical or categorical attribute. Situations not relating
to numerical and categorical attributes are explored in [1, 2].
The examples presented in this paper incorporate explanations
and calculations that go beyond those of the existing literature [1, 2, 4, 8–15]. Additionally, a more efficient algorithm
to compute t-closeness in circumstances relating to numerical
attributes is shown. This paper will ultimately help others to
calculate t-closeness, as well as provide them with examples
for use in testing.
The following section introduces the mathematics behind
the calculation of t-closeness. Three examples are then presented in Sections 3, 4, and 5. An efficient algorithm is given
in Section 6, followed by some closing remarks in Section 7.

of a table. This motivates one to (formally) quantify the level
of privacy of an anonymized table. A number of models to do
so have been proposed. One of the earliest, k-anonymity is the
minimum number of (QI) indistinguishable records in a table,
where higher values of k are generally representative of a more
secure table [7]. In the first equivalence class of Table 2, there
are three indistinguishable records, whereas there are four,
two, and five such records, respectively, in the three remaining equivalence classes. As a result, k = min(3, 4, 2, 5) = 2,
meaning that Table 2 is 2-anonymous. Suppose that a user is
interested in learning the value of the attribute Incident of a
home in zone 2C. Though the user is not able to determine
precisely which record in the first equivalence class of Table
2 is associated with that specific home, the user is still able to

infer that if it experienced an incident, it experienced a power

Calculation using the Weighted Ordered Distance

The second way of calculating the EMD requires that one first
define a notion of the distance that separates the elements of
the distributions P and Q. Let P 0 and Q0 be totally ordered
[18] multisets [19] with elements sorted in ascending order by
frequency (structures that are hereinafter referred to as sets)
associated with P and Q, respectively. Note that elements do
not need to be ordered in the case of a categorical attribute.
Multisets are used in place of conventional sets since elements
are often repeated, such as in the case of {3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 4} 6=
{3, 1, 2, 4}. Moreover, by enforcing a total ordering, one can
be sure that for any x, y, z ∈ P 0 :

let Q01

As an example,
= {14, 27, 88, 101} and P10 =
0
{14, 88} ⊆ Q1 be sets of values, where P10 is an equivalence class of Q01 . Although numbers, the elements of P10
and Q01 are effectively nothing more than labels. What matters in this context is not the particular choice of labels, but
instead the underlying probabilities of these elements. Each of
the values 14, 27, 88, and 101 appears once in Q01 , meaning
that the four probabilities, or holes, of the associated distribution Q1 are of size q1 = q2 = q3 = q4 = 1/|Q01 | = 1/4.
1. x ≤ x (reflexive [20])
Thus, Q1 = {1/4, 1/4, 1/4, 1/4}. Because each of 14 and 88 oc0

Referring again to the example of P10 and Q01 of Section

14 ∈ P10 from index i = 1 to hole v2 = 27 ∈ Q01 of size

Consider the example put forward by Li et al., which is replicated in this paper in Table 3 [1]. The quasi-identifiers Zip
Code and Age are partially obfuscated so as to prevent one
from precisely linking an individual in Table 3 to the sensitive attributes Salary and Disease. This example makes use
of the attribute Salary and the nine associated values, organized into the set Q03 = {3k, 4k, 5k, 6k, 7k, 8k, 9k, 10k, 11k},
all m = 9 of which are distinct. Reiterating the point
made in Section 2.1, the values of Q03 , although numbers,
should be regarded as nothing more than labels. Each element vj ∈ Q03 is unique, resulting in nine uniform holes of
size q1 = q2 = q3 = . . . = q9 = 1/|Q03 | = 1/9. Hence,
Q3 = (1/9, 1/9, 1/9, 1/9, 1/9, 1/9, 1/9, 1/9, 1/9).
The EMD is calculated for each of the three equivalence
classes of Table 3. The first equivalence class, correspond0

ues of Q3 , not found in P3,1 , have masses of p4 = p5 =
p6 = p7 = p8 = p9 = 0. Consequently, P3,1 =
(1/3, 1/3, 1/3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0). The second equivalence class of

Table 3, P3,2
= {6k, 8k, 11k}, has a distribution of P3,2 =

Table 3, namely P3,3
= {7k, 9k, 10k}, corresponds to the distribution P3,3 = (0, 0, 0, 0, 1/3, 0, 1/3, 1/3, 0).

Categorical Attribute

In the case of a categorical attribute, the EMD is computed
using the variational distance [1, 2], specifically
m

E 0 (P, Q) =

a measure that is equal to one-half of the Manhattan distance
[22].
As an example, consider again the scenario put forward in
Table 1. The (global) set of values of the sensitive attribute
Incident is given as
Q02 = {power outage, theft, fire, fatal accident,
sidewalk repair, pest control, tree replanting}.
The associated distribution of Q02 (with the values in
the same order as that of Q02 ) is equal to Q2 =
{5/14, 1/14, 2/14, 1/14, 3/14, 1/14, 1/14}. The first equivalence

The cost of changing P3,1 into Q3 can also be found using the
weighted ordered distance approach of Equation (6). The full
process of doing so is given in the six steps B1 , B2 , B3 , . . . ,

and Q3 is calculated as

E(P3,1 , Q3 ) =

The individual “actions” A1 , A2 , A3 , . . . , A8 of Equation (12),
shown in Figure 2, correspond to the movements of masses
that transform P3,1 into Q3 . In A1 , 2/9 from mass p1 = 1/3
of v1 = 3k is moved forward to v2 . Then, in A2 , 2/9 from
mass p2 = 1/3 of v2 = 4k, along with the 2/9 from v1 , thus
2/9 + 2/9 = 4/9, is moved forward to v . A further 2/9 is picked
3
up at v3 , yielding a total of 4/9 + 2/9 = 6/9. The first hole
is encountered at v4 , at which point 1/9 is deposited, leaving
6/9 − 1/9 = 5/9 to carry forward. In each of the remaining
five holes of v5 through v9 , a mass of 1/9 is dropped, thereby
depleting all of the available mass. Following the actions of
A1 , A2 , A3 , . . . , A8 , each element of P3,1 contains a mass of
1/9, meaning that P
3,1 has been transformed into the (uniform)
distribution Q3 .

using Equation (2), to Q3 at costs of (approximately) 0.1667
and 0.2361, respectively. Lastly, given the three EMD val-

B4 that “pass through” the “region” of A2 match up to A2 (4/9)
of Equation (12). The six actions B1 , B2 , B3 , B4 , B5 , and B6
of the “region” of A3 relate to term A3 (6/9) of Equation (12),
and so forth. Each time that an action “passes through” a “region”, it contributes a mass of 1/9 to that “region”. These individual masses of 1/9 are then collectively summed over a given
“region”, just as in Equation (12), thereby linking Equations

In the set Q05 , there is one instance of “gastric ulcer”, two
of each of “gastritis” and “stomach cancer”, one of “flu”,
two of “bronchitis”, and finally one of “pneumonia”. Accordingly, the distribution of these values over Table 3 is
Q5 = {1/9, 2/9, 2/9, 1/9, 2/9, 1/9}. In the first equivalence class
of Table 3, in particular

there is one occurrence of each of “gastric ulcer”, “gastritis”, and “stomach cancer”, yielding a distribution of P5,1 =
{1/3, 1/3, 1/3, 0, 0, 0}. Given that Disease is a categorical attribute, the EMD is calculated using Equation (9) as follows

Conclusion

This paper presents three examples of the calculation of the
one-dimensional EMD in the context of t-closeness. The first
example examines the well-known scenario given by the designers of t-closeness, the second looks at more arbitrary distributions, and the third pertains to a categorical variable. Details not previously explained elsewhere in the literature are
