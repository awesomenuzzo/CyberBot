Background  Pseudonymization is an important technique for the secure and compliant use of medical data in 
research. At its core, pseudonymization is a process in which directly identifying information is separated from 
medical research data. Due to its importance, a wide range of pseudonymization tools and services have been 
developed, and researchers face the challenge of selecting an appropriate tool for their research projects. This review 
aims to address this challenge by systematically comparing existing tools.
Methods  A systematic review was performed and is reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines where applicable. The search covered PubMed and 
Web of Science to identify pseudonymization tools documented in the scientific literature. The tools were assessed 
based on predefined criteria across four key dimensions that describe researchers’ requirements: (1) single-center vs. 
multi-center use, (2) short-term vs. long-term projects, (3) small data vs. big data processing, and (4) integration vs. 
standalone functionality.
Results  From an initial pool of 1,052 papers, 92 were selected for detailed full-text review after the title and abstract 
screening. This led to the identification of 20 pseudonymization tools, of which 10 met our inclusion criteria and 
were assessed. The results show that there are differences between the tools that make them more or less suited 
for research projects differing in regards to the dimensions described above, enabling us to provide targeted 
recommendations.
Conclusions  The landscape of existing pseudonymization tools is heterogeneous, and researchers need to carefully 
select the appropriate solutions for their research projects. Our findings highlight two Software-as-a-Service-based 
solutions that enable centralized use without local infrastructure, one tool for retrospective pseudonymization of 
existing databases, two tools suitable for local deployment in smaller, short-term projects, and two tools well-suited 
for local deployment in large, multi-center studies.

Introduction
Background
The development of modern data-driven methods in 
medicine, particularly artificial intelligence (AI), requires 
access to large datasets [ 1]. At the same time, the stud -
ies that are needed to evaluate the resulting personalized 
medicine approaches are also becoming more complex in 
terms of the number of sites and types of data involved 
[2]. This implies new challenges in terms of both site-spe -
cific and cross-site secure identity management. Medical 
data is sensitive, and its processing is governed by the law 
[3, 4]. The regulatory framework differs by jurisdiction. 
In some regions, such as the United States, medical data 
is explicitly regulated under specific laws like the Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) 
[5]. In contrast, in the European Union, medical data 
falls under the broader scope of personal information 
as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation 
(GDPR) [ 6]. To address these challenges, methods are 
needed that protect privacy while collecting and manag -
ing such data [ 7].
Pseudonymization is a common technique imple -
mented in biomedical research at the data level. Different 
laws, regulations, and guidelines recommend or man -
date it as a primary data protection mechanism [ 6, 8]. In 
contrast to other privacy-enhancing technologies, such 
as differential privacy, pseudonymization is a privacy-
by-design measure usually applied during stages of data 
collection and integration. Terms such as “pseudo-anon -
ymization” or “linked-anonymization” are used synony -
mously in some regions. In the context of our work, we 
follow the definition described in ISO/IEC 20889:2018, 
which emphasizes the replacement of directly identifying 
information while maintaining the possibility of re-iden -
tification under certain conditions [ 9]. However, the term 
pseudonymization can also be interpreted in different 
ways, such as referring to the removal of directly identi -
fying information without necessarily maintaining a link. 
In practical terms, pseudonymization means the separate 
storage of directly identifying data, such as names or per -
sonal identifiers, from the data that is required for con -
ducting the scientific analyses [ 10]. The goal is to ensure 
that data can be processed in a way that prevents direct 
attribution to specific individuals when no additional 
information is available. The identifying information is 
instead replaced with a unique pseudonym, while the 
link between the pseudonym and the identifying data is 
stored securely. This enables the linkage of different data 
types for the same patients or study participants across 
different sources and time points [ 11]. It also allows the 
re-identification of subjects when necessary and legally 
permitted, such as in the case of subsequent data collec -
tion or re-contacting due to incidental findings [ 12].Choosing the right pseudonymization tool requires 
careful consideration of various specific aspects. For 
short-term studies and projects, immediate availability 
is important. For long-term undertakings, such as the 
establishment of a sustainable research platform, seam -
less integration and scalability are essential. In settings 
focusing on the re-use of routine data, the number of 
identities that need to be processed can be very high. 
Overall, these aspects can be categorized into four key 
dimensions, which are presented in Fig.  1.
The first dimension, (1) single-center vs. multi-center, 
assesses whether a research activity takes place at a single 
or spans multiple sites. This results in different needs for 
pseudonymization, e.g., linkage of data across sites. The 
second dimension, (2) short-term vs. long-term, refers to 
the duration of use. Short-term projects focus on quick 
deployment, such as during health crises like COVID-19, 
and often include cross-sectional studies or pilot studies 
with a duration of several months. Long-term projects 
usually have higher requirements in regards to software 
maintainability, e.g., through comprehensive rights and 
roles models and interfaces to long-term storage, and 
can include longitudinal cohort studies or registry-based 
research that spans multiple years. The third dimen -
sion, (3) small data vs. big data, concerns the volume of 
the managed data. Projects that process large numbers 
of existing identities and data records have higher scal -
ability requirements. For example, qualitative interview 
studies typically fall into the category of small data, while 
population cohorts with deep phenotyping using images 
and genomics could be considered examples of big data 
projects. The fourth dimension, (4) integration vs. stand -
alone, focuses on integration into existing workflows or 
software. Standalone systems suit smaller projects with 
minimal external data interaction, while other solutions 
are better suited for integration into more comprehen -
sive platforms. As indicated by the arrows in Fig.  1, these 
dimensions are not independent but are often tied to 
each other, which means that certain project types tend 
to have common properties that can influence each other. 
Fig. 1  Dimensions for selecting a suitable pseudonymization tool

Abu Attieh et al. BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making           (2025) 25:128 
For example, tools designed for big data can typically also 
handle small data projects, and some tools may be suit -
able for both short- and long-term projects depending on 
their configuration and adaptation capabilities.
Objective
The main objective of this study is to help researchers 
with finding a pseudonymization tool fitting their spe -
cific needs. More specifically, we (1) collected pseud -
onymization tools that have been described in the 
literature and are openly available, (2) categorized their 
technical properties and development status, (3) assessed 
them regarding their suitability for projects with differ -
ent requirements according to the dimensions outlined 
above, and (4) developed recommendations for which 
tool might be most suitable for which type of project.
Methods
We performed a structured review and report our results 
following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines wher -
ever applicable [ 13]. Following a structured search and 
selection process, we assessed the identified pseudony -
mization tools based on different properties. We then 
compared the tools to make recommendations.
Selection process
As the topic of our review is placed at the intersection of 
two fields, information technology and medical research, 
we searched PubMed and the Web of Science Core Col -
lection. Our search string combined the context of 
pseudonymization with our aim to identify software tools 
or services. To identify relevant papers, we used two sets 
of keywords:
(A) Set 1: “pseudonyms” or “pseudonym” or “pseudo-
anonymous” or “pseudo-anonymization” or 
“pseudo-anonymisation” or “linked-anonymous” or 
“linked-anonymization” or “linked-anonymisation” 
or “pseudonymity” or “pseudonymization” or 
“pseudonymisation” or “pseudonymized” or 
“pseudonymised” or “pseudonymous” .
(B) Set 2: “service” or “tool” or “software” or 
“application” .
We combined them using AND logic, meaning that at 
least one term from Set A AND at least one term from 
Set B had to appear in the title or abstract. The specific 
search queries for both databases are provided in the 
Supplementary File 1.
Figure  2 shows the whole screening and selection pro -
cess, which was limited to peer-reviewed original arti -
cles, reviews and overviews in English. The final search 
was conducted on June, 18th 2024 and resulted in 1,052 articles. The results were exported as comma-separated 
value (CSV) files and imported into Rayyan, an online 
tool for collaborative systematic literature reviews [ 14]. 
Two sets of inclusion and exclusion criteria were defined 
– one for the screening of papers and one for the selec -
tion of tools.
In a first step, we removed all 192 duplicates. In the 
next step, we performed a title-and-abstract screening 
based on the predefined criteria for paper selection. We 
included articles that
  •were original research articles, review articles, or 
systematic reviews,
  •described, mentioned or referenced 
pseudonymization tools in a medical context, 
whether through use, development, implementation, 
evaluation, or discussion,
  •were published in English.
We excluded articles that
  •were opinion pieces, editorials, or commentaries,
  •were published in languages other than English.
In terms of the publication date, there were no restric -
tions. As a result, 768 articles were excluded. Most 
excluded papers focused on pseudonymization in other 
contexts, including vehicle communication technologies 
(e.g., authentication in vehicular networks) and block -
chains, or did not explicitly mention or reference a spe -
cific pseudonymization tool. Each paper was screened 
by two of the authors. In case of uncertainty or disagree -
ment, a third reviewer was consulted to resolve discrep -
ancies and reach a consensus. The third step involved a 
full-text screening. A formal quality assessment of the 
selected papers was not performed, as the primary use 
of the papers was simply to identify pseudonymization 
tools. From the remaining 92 articles, we extracted 20 
pseudonymization tools. These tools were then evaluated 
based on our predefined criteria for tool selection. We 
included tools that
  •had a primary focus on medical applications,
  •were fully developed solutions rather than 
prototypes,
  •primarily focused on registering structured 
identifying data and generating pseudonyms,
  •were publicly available or sufficiently documented to 
assess their core functionalities.
We excluded tools that
  •were designed to automatically identify or remove 
identifying data, such as Natural Language

Abu Attieh et al. BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making           (2025) 25:128 
Processing (NLP) approaches for text documents or 
image data,
  •were plugins, add-ons, or implemented 
pseudonymization functionalities embedded within 
broader software solutions.
Most of the tools were excluded as prototypes, NLP-
based de-identification approaches or embedded func -
tions in comprehensive software solutions. Ultimately, we 
included ten tools, which were referenced in 27 papers.
Data charting
The data charting process was based on the four dimen -
sions described in the background section. To categorize 
the tools along these dimensions, we selected data items 
that provide relevant indicators. These include technical 
data such as details about the pseudonymization algo -
rithm or interfaces as well as meta-data providing con -
textual information.
Primarily, we extracted the information about the 
tools from the respective papers. If necessary, a separate internet search was conducted to gather further data. The 
data extraction was performed by one reviewer and sub -
sequently verified by a second reviewer. An overview of 
the data items is shown in Table  1. The complete table of 
all collected data items is available in Supplementary File 
2.
Tool classification
For the purpose of this study, we distinguished between 
two general types of medical research projects based on 
the four key dimensions:
A. Large, complex projects, characterized by multi-
center collaboration, medium- to long-term 
duration, big data processing, and heterogeneous 
technical infrastructures.
B. Small projects, typically single-center, with short 
running times, and smaller datasets.
We associated the values collected for the data items with 
the properties of the four dimensions to identify whether

Abu Attieh et al. BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making           (2025) 25:128 
tools are tendentially better suited for projects with the 
according property. We then used the associations to 
assign them to one of the two general types of projects. 
However, this does not imply that their applicability is 
limited to these project types – many tools can be used 
in broader contexts. For the assignment, we applied a 
quantitative scoring method. Each tool received a binary 
score for each relevant property across relevant dimen -
sions (e.g., 0 = not supported,1 = supported). A total score was then calculated to assess tool suitability. The detailed 
scoring process is provided in Supplementary File 3.
Results
Overview
In this section, we provide an overview of the identified 
tools in ascending alphabetical order, followed by an 
assessment in terms of the four dimensions.
ALIIAS
ALIIAS, which stands for “ Anonymization/Pseudony -
mization with LimeSurvey integration and II-factor 
Authentication for Scientific research” , was introduced 
in 2023 [ 15]. It provides a web-based interface for pseud -
onymization and anonymization, which can be inte -
grated with the survey web application LimeSurvey [ 16]. 
Installing the software may require familiarity with this 
platform and advanced IT knowledge, particularly for 
configuring security mechanisms. The code, last updated 
in 2022, along with an extensive user manual are available 
on GitHub [ 17].
CRATE
Clinical Records Anonymisation and Text Extraction 
(CRATE) was introduced in 2017 [ 18]. It can be used to 
retrospectively pseudonymize existing structured data in 
relational databases using cryptographic methods, with 
the option to integrate external natural language process -
ing (NLP) tools for free-text data processing. Installation 
requires database setup, which may pose a challenge for 
non-technical users. The code, with its latest update in 
2024, is accessible on GitHub [ 19].
EUPID
The European Unified Patient Identity Management 
(EUPID) tool was initially developed by the Austrian 
Institute of Technology (AIT) and is managed by the 
European Commission – Joint Research Centre (EC-JRC) 
[20]. It was recommended by the European Rare Disease 
Registry Infrastructure (ERDRI) for rare disease research 
[21]. EUPID is provided as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) 
and can be used in two ways. Users can access the web-
based interface on the ERDRI platform, which allows to 
use tool directly in the browser, making it particularly 
accessible for non-technical users. Alternatively, it is pos -
sible to integrate it into other systems via an API, which 
may require programming knowledge. The source code is 
not publicly available, so potential updates cannot be ver -
ified. Documentation and workshop materials are acces -
sible on different platforms [ 22].

Service (gPAS) is a web-based application and service for 
creating and managing pseudonyms [ 23]. It supports cus -
tomized pseudonyms through prefixes, suffixes, various 
alphabet options, and domains which serve as a seman -
tic grouping of pseudonyms. While gPAS is available as a 
Docker container, its deployment involves setting up and 
hosting a server, as well as manual configuration, which 
requires IT expertise to ensure proper integration into 
existing infrastructures [ 24]. The code, updated in 2024, 
is publicly available on GitHub [ 25].
Mainzelliste
The Mainzelliste, developed in 2015 as a successor to 
the PID Generator (see below), uses a combination of 
error-correcting codes, cryptography, and random val -
ues to generate pseudonyms [ 26]. It is also available as a 
Docker container and requires the setup and hosting of 
a server as well as manual configuration, which requires 
IT expertise [ 27]. The source code is publicly available on 
Bitbucket and was last updated in 2024 [ 28].
OpenPseudonymiser
Developed by the University of Nottingham, the 
OpenPseudonymiser is a desktop application that has 
been available since 2011 and generates pseudonyms 
using a hash function with a salt. It allows users to gener -
ate hashes for one or more columns in a CSV file. Since 
it is a standalone desktop application that processes files, 
no system administration knowledge is required, mak -
ing it suitable for non-technical users. While the user 
manual indicates a source code revision in 2020, access 
to the software requires registration on the OpenPseud -
onymiser website [ 29].
ORCHESTRA Pseudonymization Tool
The ORCHESTRA Pseudonymization Tool (OPT), 
released in 2024, is implemented based on widely avail -
able office suites to support rapid deployment [ 30]. It 
supports namespaces and the management and pseudon -
ymization of patient or proband identities as well as bio -
samples. Since it integrates with commonly used office 
tools, it is particularly user-friendly and does not require 
additional IT infrastructure or system administration 
skills. The code, updated in 2024, is publicly available on 
GitHub [ 31].
PID-Generator
Initially developed in 2000, the PID-Generator uses a 
deterministic, rule-based algorithm to generate pseud -
onyms and store them in a database [ 32]. It provides a 
command line interface (CLI) and requires manual setup 
and some configuration for rule-based pseudonym gen -
eration [ 33]. Deployment therefore requires advanced 
technical expertise. The tool is available for download on the project homepage, along with documentation in Ger -
man, with no further development documented since its 
initial release [ 32].
Pseudonymization Service
The Pseudonymization Service was first launched in 
2004, extending the PID-Generator with a symmetric-
key algorithm to generate pseudonyms of fixed length 
[23]. Originally using a CLI, later updates introduced a 
desktop GUI, enabling configuration and data processing 
through specific configuration files and physical media. 
Initial setup is done via configuration files, which may 
require some technical expertise. The documentation 
available on the project homepage is outdated and only 
covers the first version of the software in German [ 34]. 
Access to the service, which was last updated in 2019, 
must be requested from the developer [ 35].
SPIDER
Launched in 2022, the software Secure Privacy-preserv -
ing Identity management in Distributed Environments 
for Research (SPIDER) is provided via the European 
Platform on Rare Disease Registration (EU RD Plat -
form). Unlike EUPID, SPIDER is exclusively intended for 
research on rare diseases [ 36, 37]. SPIDER is provided as 
SaaS solution and also offers users the ability to access 
it via the web-based interface on the ERDRI platform, 
allowing the tool to be used directly in browsers. Alterna -
tively, it is possible to develop a dedicated SPIDER client 
as a stand-alone or plug-in solution, which may require 
programming knowledge.
The source code is not publicly accessible, so potential 
updates cannot be verified. However, the EU RD Plat -
form website provides comprehensive documentation 
and detailed training videos [ 38].
Comparison
When comparing the identifying tools, it can first be seen 
that they have been implemented for distinct application 
scenarios:
(1) Software-as–a-Service solutions: EUPID and SPIDER 
are provided as hosted-services that can either be 
used within EU platforms or integrated into other 
applications. This means that specific legal bases 
(e.g., consent) and contracts are needed to use 
them in a compliant manner. Both solutions offer 
comparable functionalities (pseudonym spaces, data 
linkage, batch processing, and an API), with SPIDER 
focusing on rare disease research.
(2) Pseudonymization of existing data: The primary 
focus of CRATE is on pseudonymizing existing 
databases with structured, and potentially 
unstructured, data for further research use. CRATE 
Page 7 of 10
Abu Attieh et al. BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making           (2025) 25:128 
supports pseudonym spaces, dataset linkage, and 
batch processing, but does not provide an API.
(3) Pseudonymization of existing as well as newly 
collected data: ALIIAS, gPAS, Mainzelliste, 
OpenPseudonymiser, OPT, PID-Generator and the 
Pseudonymization Service all provide functionalities 
to pseudonymize new records in a transactional 
manner, making them suited for integration into data 
collection processes, for example.
The remainder of this comparison focuses on the largest 
group of tools, i.e., those designed to support the pseud -
onymization of existing as well as newly collected data.
Multi-center studies use data from multiple institu -
tions, which often requires tools to support non-over -
lapping pseudonym spaces. Considering that study 
participants may switch between different centers, record 
linkage becomes necessary to maintain accurate track -
ing of participant data across centers. To facilitate the 
data and workflow integration between the participat -
ing institutions, there are often requirements to integrate 
their systems, e.g., requiring a central service with an 
API. Similarly, a central tool usually requires a web-based 
interface. In contrast, in single-center settings, tools are 
not always used by a larger group of individuals, so native 
user interfaces can be sufficient and API integration may 
not be necessary.
In short-term projects, where the focus is often on 
quick implementation and immediate results, stand -
alone solutions with native interfaces and limited API 
integration are often sufficient. These solutions are typi -
cally easier to set up and maintain. In contrast, long-term projects often require more flexibility and support for a 
larger user group, making web-based services more suit -
able. The availability of an API can enable the integra -
tion with other systems, which is a typical requirement 
for long-term structures. Moreover, the ability to link 
and update the data managed by the service is likely to 
become critical.
Studies or projects dealing with small data often 
involve manual data collection, e.g., following a pre-
defined study protocol, which may reduce the necessity 
for batch processing. Furthermore, projects managing 
only small amounts of data are also often short-term, 
single center projects that can be supported well with 
simpler tools offering only native interfaces and limited 
API integration. In contrast, projects involving big data 
usually require batch processing capabilities, which is 
often easier to achieve with a web-based service offering 
an API. Similarly, studies or projects that require integra -
tion with other systems and structures, e.g., for data col -
lection or biobanking, are also easier to set up using an 
API, while more isolated standalone projects can often be 
carried out with simpler tools that don’t offer one.
Figure  3 illustrates the suitability of pseudonymiza -
tion tools for projects with different properties. The 
comparison shows two extreme cases based on the 
example scenarios defined in the introduction: (A) large 
projects (multi-center, long-term, big data, integra -
tion) and (B) small projects (single-center, short-term, 
small data, standalone). The arrow illustrates the range 
between these two extremes. Tools such as Mainzel -
liste and gPAS are more suitable for complex projects, 
while OpenPseudonymiser, OPT, PID-Generator and the 
Fig. 3  Suitability of pseudonymization tools for projects with different properties

Pseudonymization Service are generally more suitable 
for smaller projects. ALIIAS could also be used for long-
term projects, but is generally more suitable for small 
projects. The color coding indicates which project prop -
erties are tool addresses particularly well.
Most of the mentioned tools support both pseud -
onym spaces and record linkage. However, ALIIAS sup -
ports pseudonym spaces but not record linkage, making 
it more suitable for specific use cases, such as sur -
veys. The Pseudonymization Service neither supports 
pseudonym spaces nor record linkage. Tools that sup -
port operations like deleting, updating or anonymizing 
pseudonymized data e.g., to correct an entry or to meet 
legal requirements (such as requests under GDPR data 
subject rights) include gPAS, the Mainzelliste and the 
OPT. Batch processing is supported by most tools, with 
the exception of ALIIAS, which only allows direct data 
entry. The OpenPseudonymiser and the Pseudonymiza -
tion Service only support batch processing via prepared 
lists, such as CSV files, while direct entry is not possible. 
User interfaces vary between web-based and native appli -
cations. For long-term use, having a tool provided as a 
web-based service instead a locally installed software is 
often preferable, as it facilitates ongoing maintenance 
and adaptation to changing requirements. Web-based 
tools, including ALIIAS, gPAS, and Mainzelliste, allow 
flexible access via a browser. In contrast, native applica -
tions such as OpenPseudonymiser, OPT, PID-Generator, 
and the Pseudonymization Service require local installa -
tion. However, the OpenPseudonymiser and the OPT can 
be deployed quickly due to their minimal infrastructure 
requirements. Mainzelliste offers a modern, user-friendly 
GUI with a RESTful API, facilitating seamless integration 
with other systems. Similarly, gPAS supports integration 
but relies on a SOAP-based API instead of REST. Native 
tools like OpenPseudonymiser, OPT, PID-Generator, and 
the Pseudonymization Service offer GUIs but lack APIs. 
This makes them more suitable for deployments that do 
not require external programming integration.
Discussion
Principal findings and related work
Our review identified and we systematically analyzed 
ten pseudonymization tools for biomedical research 
and highlighted seven tools that demonstrate particu -
lar strengths in addressing key requirements of medi -
cal research projects. SPIDER and EUPID are options, 
if external SaaS offerings are needed and can be used. 
CRATE, on the other hand, is a tool specifically focus -
ing on the pseudonymization of existing databases. For 
local deployments, two tools are particularly suited for 
large and two for smaller projects. In the context of larger 
projects (1) gPAS is well suited for multi-center stud -
ies as well as local long-term projects and it can also be combined with further tools for consent management 
and patient registration, and (2) the Mainzelliste, with its 
RESTful interface, supports both efficient data pseudony -
mization and flexible integration into existing research 
networks.
For short-term studies and smaller local projects, the 
(3) OpenPseudonymiser and the (4) OPT can be rec -
ommended, as they support the most features, includ -
ing pseudonym spaces, record linkage and secondary 
pseudonymization.
There are also tools and services designed to handle 
data in different interoperability formats, such as the 
FHIR Pseudonymizer for clinical data [ 39].
Several articles and studies have previously addressed 
the topic of pseudonymization and its role in medical 
research. Kohlmayer et al. [ 10] explored the challenges 
of pseudonymization in the context of real-world data 
collection, emphasizing the importance of balancing 
data protection with research needs. Similarly, Lauten -
schläger et al. [ 12] provided a solution for the web-based 
management of pseudonymized data, focusing on scal -
ability and security in distributed research environments. 
The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) 
outlines different pseudonymization scenarios and pro -
vides detailed technical recommendations on methods 
and best practices in its report [ 8]. However, it does not 
offer a comparison or even a recommendation of specific 
pseudonymization tools. Recent work by Gehrmann et 
al. [3] focused on the barriers to secondary use of medi -
cal data across research sites, pointing out that legal and 
technical challenges remain significant. It referred, for 
example, to the challenges arising from the use of dif -
ferent identifiers at different sites. These works primar -
ily form the basis for understanding the complexity of 
selecting and implementing pseudonymization tools.
Limitations and future work
This review focuses specifically on pseudonymization 
tools for medical re-search, which introduces several 
limitations.
First, our analysis does not include advanced privacy-
enhancing techniques, which have gained traction in the 
field of biomedical and healthcare research, such as dif -
ferential privacy [ 40]. However, while these techniques 
offer rigorous privacy guarantees, they operate on a dif -
ferent conceptual level and were outside the scope of our 
study. Pseudonymization serves a fundamentally differ -
ent purpose, as it enables the collection and integration 
of patient data while implementing privacy-by-design 
principles, particularly under frameworks such as the 
GDPR, ensuring data protection even when full anony -
mization is not possible or needed.
Second, our study relies exclusively on literature- and 
documentation-based assessments without practical

experimentation or benchmarking. This approach limits 
the ability to evaluate factors such as the user-friendli -
ness or real-world performance. In future work, we plan 
to conduct empirical evaluations using representative 
medical datasets and application scenarios to provide a 
more practical comparison.
Finally, our search strategy primarily identified tools 
from European, particularly German, contexts. While 
this may indicate a selection bias, we would also like to 
emphasize that pseudonymization has gained significant 
prominence in the EU with the adoption of the GDPR, 
where it plays a major role, and that Germany has a long-
established tradition of using pseudonymization in medi -
cal research.
Conclusion
To the best of our knowledge, we presented the first sys -
tematic review of pseudonymization tools for biomedical 
research. Our work shows that pseudonymization tools 
can be compared along different dimensions, which can 
in turn be used to identify those that are specifically well 
suited for supporting certain types of medical research 
projects.
