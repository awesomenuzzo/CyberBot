1 Introduction  
The quantity of Internet users has increased as a result of the Information Technology (IT) industry's 
recent rapid expansion. Internet access has given people around the world  and has  an excellent chance 
to communicate and enjoy life better.  Additionally, it has given credit card companies and financial 
companies fresh motivation to expand into untapped markets and generate development prospects for 
the economy  (Carrasco et al., 2020) . Receiving credit card payments entails providing the merchant with 
pertinent data, like the card number, payment amount, expiration date  and so on, before submitting to 
the Payment Gateway (PG), it should be verified  (Campos, 2024) . The processor receives the financial 
details provided by the PG and links up with the client's financial institution to determine to forward or 
deny the inquiry  (Roseline et al., 2022 ; Rakesh et al., 2024 ). Instead of payment being transmitted right 
away to the merchant's bank , a digital payment to ken for a certified transaction a merchant's  electronic 
payment information is given.  The growth of Internet -based companies has been primarily described to 
consumers' increased trust in the company, as well as the degree to which data security  in financial cloud 
computing  may be upheld  (Gamini et al., 202 ; Rabet & Mousavi, 2017 ). However, given the increasing 
range of theft, fraud, difficulties, and loss of service attacks on the financial data , users have express ed 
grave worries, uncertainties  and loss of faith surrounding credit card information reloc ation, 
confidentiality, honesty  and privacy  in financial cloud computing  (Shrivastava & Ahmed, 2024) . 
Millions of dollars have been lost every year as a result of security flaws in both old and current credit 
card platforms that have been made vulnera ble by intrusion, theft of data  and other attacks  in financial 
data (Sreeja et al., 2018) . Due to security holes in both older and newer credit card networks that have 
been  exposed by hacking, data theft  and other attacks, millions of money have been lost annually  (Cherif 
et al., 2024) . Credit card fraud about merchants can take two forms: triangulation, wherein thieves use 
legitimate credit card details and customer information to order goods from a reputable website, or 
collusion, wherein the retailer and/or staff collaborate to perpetrate fraud by exploiting the customers' 
account information and/or personal information (Noviandy et al., 2023) . The risks of credit card fraud 
are frequently shared by the cardholder, who m ight not be aware of the attack  and the ret ailer. While 
retailers incur lost sales due to payback fees and the possibility of account deletion or suspension, 
cardholders face the difficult task of having a fraudulent payment reversed (Chakraborty et al., 
2023) .This paper introduces an innovative method called Tokenized Elliptic -Homomorphic 
Cryptography (TE -HC) which improves the financial information security in cloud computing. 
Additionally, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is integrated to detect the data is norma l or potentially intrusive 
in financial  information  (Uvarajan, 2024 ; Maurya et al., 2025 ). 
The following sections comprise the study, Section 2 includes  the relevant works, and Section  3 
outlines  the methodology. The experimental results of the study are shown in section 4.  There is a 
conclusion in section 5.  
2 Related Works  
Strelcenia & Prakoonwit , (2023)  introduced a knowledge -based Conditional Generative Adversarial 
Network)  K-CGAN, a novel data augmentation technique, to identify scams involving credit cards and 
looks into several techniques for data augmentation to deal with the issue of inconsistent dat a. These 
results show the superior Precision and Recall when compared to other approaches.

AI-integrated Encryption and Tokenization Framework                                                 Dr. Dipti N. Kashyap et al.  
 
318 Taha  & Malebary , (2020)  proposed a method that effectively detects credit card scams by using an 
optimized light gradient boosting machine (OLightGBM). When the proposed strategy was compared 
to other ways employing the two sources of data, it generated the best results with a F1-score, accuracy, 
precision  and the area of the operating characteristic of the receiver curve.  
Alenzi & Aljehane , (2020)  suggested that the method uses logistic regression to develop the classifier 
to prevent financial credit card transaction fraud. The two widely used classifiers, r egarding precision, 
sensitivity  and mistake frequency, the proposed classifier outperforms both the support vector machine 
and voting classifiers.  
Tokenization was an additional database system security strategy suggested by Agboola et al., (2022) 
that involved replacing or substituting personal information with a token. The findings indicate that, in 
comparison to other security solutions, the token ization technique has a high ability to secure sensitive 
data in cloud computing.  
A security measure t okenization was the foundation of the strategy presented by Petrus (2023).  A 
working prototype of the proposed strategy was created. The findings indicate that tokenization may 
eventually take the role of conventional encryption methods for cloud -based BI data security.  
Ileberi  et al., (2021)  developed a machine learning (ML) based identity theft solution by using actual 
uneven data sets obtained from European credit merchants. Furthermore, the enhanced models produced 
better outcomes than the existing  techniques.  
Jayanthi et al., (2023) suggested ML can lessen the burden on financial institutions by assisting in 
the detection of fraudulent use of credit cards in transactions . The suggested method's performance was  
compared with the existing method and outperformed the other methods.  
Habibpour et al., (2023) presented  three uncertainty quantification (UQ) approaches for card fraud 
prediction.   Demonstrate through research findings that the ensemble performs better at capturing 
insecurity related to providing forecasts.  
Kuttiyappan  & Rajasekar  (2024)  suggested  three AI -based methods for fraud detection are presented . 
The effectiveness of the AI -powered  methods was  contrasted with random for est models, logistic 
regression  and conventional rule -based  systems. A thorough analysis was  conducted to understand  
whether the new AI -based techniques are better at identifying fraudulent activity.  
Duan et al., ( 2024 ) prese nted a new approach to the identification of fraudulent use of credit cards. 
Our results demonstrate d the possibility of combining neural networks with graphs and causal reasoning 
to enhance the detection of fraud in monetary transactions.  
3 Proposed System  
Initially we gather dataset from Kaggle which shows the credit card transaction dataset that includes 
both valid and fraudulent transactions . From the data intrusive detection can be detected using 𝜈 -Support 
Vector Classification ( 𝜈 -SVC) . From the detection shows the data is intrusive reject and normal is 
consider for the merchant and tokenization module and the data is stored in cloud. Figure 1 shows the 
overview of the methodology .

Figure 1: Overview  of Methodology  
3.1. Intrusive Detection  
To detect the intrusive in credit card information using 𝜈 -Support Vector Classification ( 𝜈 -SVC). A 
binary classification scenario is n -support vector classification (n -SVC) . As there is no priori way for 
choosing parameter C in 𝐶−𝑆𝑉𝐶, a parameter 𝜈∈(0,1]  is added in place of parameter C to control the 
amount of margin errors and support vectors. There  is a lower constraint on the fraction of 𝑆𝑉𝑠 and a 
maximum limit on the proportion of marginal defects for parameter 𝑛. (Eq. 1)

    𝜉𝑗≥0,𝜌≥0        (1) 
If variable 𝜉𝑗>0then the margin error indicates samples with training mistakes with a condition 
(𝜉𝑗>𝜌) or dwells in the margin if (𝜉𝑗∈(0,𝜌)), then the marginal among the two classes is2𝜌
||𝑥||. One 
way to derive the decision limit is to  (Eq. 2) : 
𝑒(𝑤)=𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛 (∑ 𝜆𝑖𝑧𝑖𝑙(𝑤𝑗,𝑤𝑖)+𝑎𝑀
𝑗,𝑖=1 )      (2) 
Two sets 𝑇± of the same size (𝑡>0)that contain support vectors 𝑤𝑗 about      0<𝜆𝑗<1      and 𝑧𝑗=
±1are used to determine the bias term 𝑎 and marginal factor 𝜌 as shown below  (Eq. 3) .

𝑗=1 𝑤∈𝑇+)      (3) 
It should be mentioned that the decision procedure just needs 𝑎. 
3.2. Merchant and Tokenization Module  
While the tokenization module managed by the payment gateway is used to generate transaction 
validation tokens, the seller's module acts as a conduit for  financial  consumers (the holders of debit and 
credit cards) to send credit card information. A database with regulated and limited access that is housed 
on a cloud storage engine is called the token vault. A credit card number is made up of the account 
number, the check digit, and the bank identi ty number (BIN), as indicated.  
3.3. Card Number Validation  
Applying the Luhn formula, the merchant v erifies the credit card number. Taking into consideration 
that = {𝐵1,𝐵2,...,𝐵𝑚−1,𝐵𝑚}denotes an n -digit credit card sequence.  
The both even and odd products' digits are added up to yield the sums 𝑇1and𝑇2, respectively,  (Eq. 4 -
6): 
𝑇1= ∑ 𝑘𝑙; {𝑘𝑙𝑖𝑓𝑘𝑙<10
𝑘𝑙=(𝑘𝑙10)+(𝑘𝑙𝑚𝑜𝑑  10)𝑖𝑓𝑘𝑙≥10 ⁄𝑚−1
𝑙=1                               (4) 
𝑇2=∑ (𝐵𝑙)∀𝑗=1,⋯𝑚−1𝑚−1
𝑙=2𝑖                                   (5) 
𝑦=(𝑇1+𝑇2)+𝐵𝑚                                   (6) 
The numbers that are in the 𝑙𝑡ℎ odd and even positions, respectively, are doubled to produce 𝑘𝑙and. 
If  𝑦 mod 10 = 0, the  card value is verified. The credit card value is encrypted using the following 
cryptographic scheme  (Eq. 7 & 8) : 
𝐹(𝑁)→𝑑         (7) 
𝐶(𝐷)→𝑁         (8) 
Encryption, message (plaintext), cipher text and decryption are represented by the letters 𝐹,𝑁,𝐷and𝐶, 
in that order.  
3.4. Homomorphic  
Building up a secure foundation is the essential step in protecting cloud information privacy. Here , cloud 
data storage security is enhanced by the development of homomorp hic-elliptic curve cryptography . The 
use of mathematical operations on encrypted data is allowed by homomorphic encryption, allowing the 
decrypted data to have the same matching operations applied to the plaintext data.  The process of 
encoding data so that attackers cannot read it is known as encryption. Two different kinds of encryption 
methods exist. Figure 2 shows the architectural layout of the proposed system.

Figure 2: Architectural Layout of the Hybrid Encryption and Decryption Algorithm  
Homomorphic  and Elliptic Curve Cryptography  (ECC ). Each slice's data have been encrypted with 
a different encryption key and cryptographic technique before being uploaded to the cloud. The goal of 
this method is to cut down on the expense and time associated with storing encrypted information in 
cloud stor age while maintaining a legitimate, safe, and secure data storage method to ward against 
intrusions and data attacks. The homomorphic algorithm i s symmetric key cryptography the  data is 
encrypted and stored using elliptic curve encryption. Several  steps of the proposed system are key 
generation, encryption , and  decryption.  
Before being saved in the cloud, the data are first encrypted using the keys and the Elliptic  Curve 
algorithm. After that, the cipher text is encrypted another time using the homomorphic  algorithm. The 
public and private keys are generated using the key generation algorithm. When the encrypted data is 
sent to the user, they utilize their chosen decryption technique to unlock the original text within the 
encryption.  
Key Generation  
An algorithm used in public key cryptography is called elliptic curve cryptography. Originally intended 
simply for use as a digital signature, it was eventually upgraded to include encryption and decryption 
capabilities. The discrete logarithm underpins the algorithm's strength.  
1. Select a prime number B at random.  

Enhancing Credit Card Data Security Using                        
AI-integrated Encryption and Tokenization Framework                                                 Dr. Dipti N. Kashyap et al.  
 
322 2. Select two numbers at random, a and d, such that (a<b)and(d<b).  
3. Determine c = a ^ dmod b.  
4. The public key is C, the private key is D, and both b  and a  are public.  
A public prime number is chosen at random, B. Two further random numbers are selected, one of 
which is open and the o ther secret. In this instance, a is the open one and d  is the secret. Key creation 
can be done in different sizes, and as the key gets bigger, so does the security and computational time. 
This represents a drawback for the millennial generation.  
Encryption  
Encryption is the process of encoding plaintext or data so that, regardless of the file's visibility, it can be 
recognized due to its encoding. Even, encryption is a technology employed in data security. A modern 
encryption method called elliptic curve cry ptography encrypts data publicly while decrypting it 
privately. When compared to other algorithms, it offers security at a lower cost because it provides 
security through all of the algorithms.  
Additionally, it offers secure key transmission between users.

Then, for the plain text n, select a random integer qt, if the Paillier private key is (oq,ov) and the 
public key is (M,h). Encryption is the process of  (Eq. 9)  
𝐷=ℎ ^ 𝑛∗𝑞𝑡𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑚 ∗𝑚.                        (9) 
It works fit with the cloud's privacy and security of data issues. Data is safely stored in the cloud 
using elliptic curve and homomorphic curve cryptography. The private key and the input data make up 
the algorithm's input. Then ,𝐿𝑜𝑣is formed in the curve public key using the generating function ℎ. 
Similarly, four random numbers qt are used to construct cipher text. Subsequently, the provided input is 
encrypted using our produced public key and the random algorithm on the cipher text. The encrypted 
data that is kept in the file is the output.  
Decryption  
The method of decrypting encrypted text or data allows us to view the original file after it has been 
decrypted. Following a user request for a data file, the encrypted data undergoes homomorphic 
processing. After applying elliptic curve cryptography to the cipher text created by the homomorphic 
process, the entire process may be decrypted using the private key, allowing us to obtain the original 
data.  The process starts with a  private key and encrypted data  and the result is the original, encrypted 
file. To create the c ipher text, we first need the secret key and the encrypted data. From the curve, we

323 generate function g by taking the random integer that we obtained using the private key.  The process is 
repeated using the public key for decryption, and the original output is generated by subtracting the 
output from the cipher text encrypted using the private key. One of the main difficulties with this 
procedure is that different algorithms  create varied key sizes, even when the algorithms are run in an 
equal manner.  To prevent intrusions into the cloud environment, we should authenticate cloud providers.  
Many techniques exist for this, including authorization and authentication procedures as well as modern 
cloud security protocols that limit cloud platform access to authorized users exclusively.

3.5. Tokenization  
The encrypted content is stored in the credential vault (token database) along with the token that was 
created from the credit card number. Using the actual card information , the tokenization function creates 
tokens after decrypting the encrypted data.  An integer sequence is created during tokenization by the 
use of a random number generator. Tokenization of the real payment card number for every credit card 
number is represented by the last four numbers on the right , which calculates to the sixth digit from the 
left position . Since V is the transaction upper bound and 𝑖is a counter for the number of transactions, 
let's assume that 𝑗=1 𝑡𝑜𝑉. 
For the first tr ansaction to produce a token ,𝑗 = 1. (Eq. 10)  
𝑆1=(𝑤.𝐵𝑙+𝑧)𝑚𝑜𝑑 𝐵𝑙 ,∀𝑚,𝑙=1⋯𝑖,∀𝑤,𝑧=0⋯9                                                  (10) 
For the second transaction, 𝑗 = 2. 
Produce a new token 𝑆1 from token 𝑆2 if the credit card number remains the same; else use the card 
number to generate the token 𝑆2. 
For the transaction with an upper limit where 𝑗 = 𝑉 
Token 𝑆𝑉 is formed from token 𝑆𝑉−1 if the credit card number stays the same; if not, token 𝑆𝑉 is 
generated from the card number.  
A payment card numbers  where 𝑗 = 1,2,...The produced token is 𝑉, the random single digit numbers 
𝑤 and𝑧 are, and the sixth digit is i . The notation mod 𝐵𝑙 modifies the expression enclosed in parenthesis 
by dividing it by 𝐵𝑙 and then substituting the resultant value. The random number generator's properties 
are determined by the parameter 𝑤𝑧 and the selection of 𝑤and.

324 4 Experimental Results  
We gather dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud -detection/data which 
include s the credit card transaction dataset containing legitimate and fraud transactions. T o evaluate d 
the proposed method with existing method such as Encryption ( AES ), Encoding ( BASE64 ), Hashing 
(SHA -2) and Tokenization  (Agboola et al., 2022 ). 
The web -based solution uses authentication to keep the admin and user sessions apart. During the 
user session, the user navigates through the confirmation, tokenization, encryption, Luhn test, 
registration, login, and home page screens. The registration interface is users register and set up their 
accounts, whereas the home screen displays system information. It takes users to the login screen, where 
their previously registered passwords and usernames are used to verify their identity. Figure 3 illustrates 
how to utilize the Luhn Test interface as the initial stage of TE-HC-based encryption and to check if a 
Master, Verve, or Visa card number is acceptable.  
 
Figure 3: The Luhn Test  
The encry ption interface, shown in Fig ure 4(a), which displays the Luhn time, its status, a card 
number undergoing validation, and an outcome report, signifies the end of this test. As shown in Fig ure 
4(b), the decryption page containing the retrieved ciphertext appears when the encryption interactive 
procedure is finished. A credit card number cannot be accessed because it is encrypted.

system maintains records of user information, including the date and time of the operation, the token 
that was generated, the token that was received, the ackno wledgment times, the new module  and the 
public keys acquired for Elliptic -Homomorphic Cryptography (TE -HC) algorithm -based operations on 
Master, Verve, or Visa credit card details.

"effectiveness," and "usability." Ratings for "security" and "user experience" were also noted.  These 
scores indicated that the system was well regarded by the chosen users and that they were confident in 
its ability to securely store information about their credit cards during secure financial transactions.  
Memory usage referred to the term used to describe how effectively computer storage resources were 
allocated and used to process and store encrypted credit card data. Improving memory efficiency 
guarantees quick data access and cryptographic processes, sup porting overall security protocols.  Figure 
6 and table 2  shows the outcome of memory usage.  Compared to existing techniques Advanced 
Encryption Standard ( AES), BASE64, SHA -2, Tokenization  our proposed method had lower (TE-HC).  
In comparison to the existing  approach, the suggested method (TE -HC) showed significant 
improvements in enhancing credit card security data.

5 Conclusion  
In this paper, tokenized Elliptic -Homomorphic Cryptography (TE -HC), an inventive method supported 
by artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, is proposed in this study. In addition to enhancing user 
experience and efficiency, TE -HC also strengthens the integrity of fina ncial information.  The system 
reduces the danger of unwanted access and data exposure by ensuring secured and authorized 
transmission of credit card details through its merchant and tokenization elements and secure token 
vault. The results of the implement ation show how fast and effective TE -HC is, surpassing conventional 
techniques in credit card security.  TE-HC presents a strong answer to the major problems associated 
with protecting credit card information in the digital age by combining i mproved security, effectiveness  
and user -friendly design.  The deployment of TE -HC could be hindered by the requirement for specialist 
hardware and possible incompatibilities with legacy systems.  It offers features including fast transaction 
processing, hybrid AI-driven i ntrusion detection and safe tokenization , to improve the security of credit 
card data .
