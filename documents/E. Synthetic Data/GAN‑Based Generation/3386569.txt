Our work explores temporal self-supervision for GAN-based video generation tasks. While adversarial training successfully yields generative models
for a variety of areas, temporal relationships in the generated data are much
less explored. Natural temporal changes are crucial for sequential generation
tasks , e.g. video super-resolution and unpaired video translation. For the
former, state-of-the-art methods often favor simpler norm losses such as
𝐿 2 over adversarial training. However, their averaging nature easily leads
to temporally smooth results with an undesirable lack of spatial detail. For
unpaired video translation, existing approaches modify the generator networks to form spatio-temporal cycle consistencies. In contrast, we focus
on improving learning objectives and propose a temporally self-supervised
algorithm. For both tasks, we show that temporal adversarial learning is key
to achieving temporally coherent solutions without sacrificing spatial detail.
We also propose a novel Ping-Pong loss to improve the long-term temporal

INTRODUCTION

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been extremely successful at learning complex distributions such as natural images [Isola
et al. 2017; Zhu et al. 2017]. However, for sequence generation,
directly applying GANs without carefully engineered constraints
typically results in strong artifacts over time due to the significant difficulties introduced by the temporal changes. In particular,
conditional video generation tasks are very challenging learning
problems where generators should not only learn to represent the

data distribution of the target domain but also learn to correlate the
output distribution over time with conditional inputs. Their central
objective is to faithfully reproduce the temporal dynamics of the
target domain and not resort to trivial solutions such as features
that arbitrarily appear and disappear over time.
In our work, we propose a novel adversarial learning method
for a recurrent training approach that supervises both spatial contents as well as temporal relationships. As shown in Fig. 1, we
apply our approach to two video-related tasks that offer substantially different challenges: video super-resolution (VSR) and unpaired
video translation (UVT). With no ground truth motion available, the
spatio-temporal adversarial loss and the recurrent structure enable
our model to generate realistic results while keeping the generated structures coherent over time. With the two learning tasks
we demonstrate how spatio-temporal adversarial training can be
employed in paired as well as unpaired data domains. In addition to
the adversarial network which supervises the short-term temporal
coherence, long-term consistency is self-supervised using a novel
bi-directional loss formulation, which we refer to as “Ping-Pong”
(PP) loss in the following. The PP loss effectively avoids the temporal
accumulation of artifacts, which can potentially benefit a variety
of recurrent architectures. We also note that most existing image
metrics focus on spatial content only. We fill the gap of temporal
assessment with a pair of metrics that measures the perceptual similarity over time and the similarity of motions with respect to a
ground truth reference. User studies confirm these metrics for both
tasks.
The central contributions of our work are:
• a spatio-temporal discriminator unit together with a careful
analysis of training objectives for realistic and coherent video
generation tasks,
• a novel PP loss supervising long-term consistency,
• in addition to a set of metrics for quantifying temporal coherence based on motion estimation and perceptual distance.
Together, our contributions lead to models that outperform previous
work in terms of temporally-coherent detail, which we qualitatively
and quantitatively demonstrate with a wide range of content.

RELATED WORK

Deep learning has made great progress for image generation tasks.
While regular losses such as 𝐿 2 [Kim et al. 2016; Lai et al. 2017] offer
good performance for image super-resolution (SR) tasks in terms of
PSNR metrics, previous work found adversarial training [Goodfellow et al. 2014] to significantly improve the perceptual quality in
multi-modal settings such as image generation [Brock et al. 2019],
colorization [He et al. 2018], super-resolution [Ledig et al. 2016],
and translation [Isola et al. 2017; Zhu et al. 2017] tasks. Besides representing natural images, GAN-based frameworks are also successful
at static graphic representations including geometry synthesis [Wu
et al. 2019] and city modeling [Kelly et al. 2018].
Sequential generation tasks, on the other hand, require the generation of realistic content that changes naturally over time [Kim
et al. 2019; Xie et al. 2018]. It is especially so for conditional video
generation tasks [Jamriška et al. 2019; Sitzmann et al. 2018; Wronski
et al. 2019; Zhang et al. 2019], where specific correlations between

the input and the generated spatio-temporal evolution are required
when ground-truth motions are not provided. Hence, motion estimation [Dosovitskiy et al. 2015; Liu et al. 2019] and compensation
become crucial for video generation tasks. The compensation can
take various forms, e.g., explicitly using variants of optical flow
networks [Caballero et al. 2017; Sajjadi et al. 2018; Shi et al. 2016]
and implicitly using deformable convolution layers [Wang et al.
2019a; Zhu et al. 2019] or dynamic up-sampling [Jo et al. 2018]. In
our work, a network is trained to estimate the motion and we show
that it can help generators and discriminators in spatio-temporal
adversarial training.
For VSR, recent work improve the spatial detail and temporal
coherence by either using multiple low-resolution (LR) frames as
inputs [Haris et al. 2019; Jo et al. 2018; Liu et al. 2017; Tao et al.
2017] or recurrently using previously estimated outputs [Sajjadi
et al. 2018]. The latter has the advantage to re-use high-frequency
details over time. In general, adversarial learning is less explored for
VSR and applying it in conjunction with a recurrent structure gives
rise to a special form of temporal mode collapse, as we will explain
below. For video translation tasks, GANs are more commonly used
but discriminators typically only supervise the spatial content. E.g.,
Zhu et al. [2017] focuses on images without temporal constrains
and generators can fail to learn the temporal cycle-consistency for
videos. In order to learn temporal dynamics, RecycleGAN [Bansal
et al. 2018] proposes to use a prediction network in addition to a
generator, while a concurrent work [Chen et al. 2019] chose to learn
motion translation in addition to the spatial content translation.
Being orthogonal to these works, we propose a spatio-temporal adversarial training for both VSR and UVT and we show that temporal
self-supervision is crucial for improving spatio-temporal correlations without sacrificing spatial detail.
While 𝐿 1 and 𝐿 2 temporal losses based on warping are generally used to enforce temporal smoothness in video style transfer
tasks [Chen et al. 2017; Ruder et al. 2016] and concurrent GAN-based
VSR [Pérez-Pellitero et al. 2018] and UVT [Park et al. 2019] work,
it leads to an undesirable smooth over spatial detail and temporal
changes in outputs. Likewise, the 𝐿 2 temporal metric represents a
sub-optimal way to quantify temporal coherence. For image similarity evaluation, perceptual metrics [Prashnani et al. 2018; Zhang et al.
2018] are proposed to reliably consider semantic features instead of
pixel-wise errors. However, for videos, perceptual metrics that evaluate natural temporal changes are unavailable up to now. To address
this open issue, we propose two improved temporal metrics and
demonstrate the advantages of temporal self-supervision over direct
temporal losses. Due to its complexity, VSR has also led to workshop challenges like NTIRE19 [Nah et al. 2019], where algorithms
such as EDVR [Wang et al. 2019a] perform best w.r.t. PSNR-based
metrics. We compare to these methods and give additional details
in Appendix A.
Previous work, e.g. tempoGAN for fluid flow [Xie et al. 2018]
and vid2vid for video translation [Wang et al. 2018a], has proposed
adversarial temporal losses to achieve time consistency. While tempoGAN employs a second temporal discriminator with multiple
aligned frames to assess the realism of temporal changes, it is not
suitable for videos, as it relies on ground truth motions and employs
single-frame processing that is sub-optimal for natural images. On

Learning Temporal Coherence via Self-Supervision for GAN-based Video Generation

the other hand, vid2vid focuses on paired video translations and
proposes a video discriminator based on a conditional motion input
that is estimated from the paired ground-truth sequences. We focus
on more difficult unpaired translation tasks instead and demonstrate
the gains in the quality of our approach in the evaluation section.
Bashkirova et al. [2018] solve UVT tasks as a 3D extension of the
2D image translation. In DeepFovea [Kaplanyan et al. 2019], a 3D
discriminator is used to supervise video in-painting results with 32
frames as a single 3D input. Since temporal evolution differs from a
spatial distribution, we show how a separate handling of the temporal dimension can reduce computational costs, remove training
restrictions, and most importantly improve inference quality.
For tracking and optical flow estimation, 𝐿 2 -based time-cycle
losses [Wang et al. 2019b] were proposed to constrain motions and
tracked correspondences using symmetric video inputs. By optimizing indirectly via motion compensation or tracking, this loss
improves the accuracy of the results. For video generation, we propose a PP loss that also makes use of symmetric sequences. However,
we directly constrain the PP loss via the generated video content,
which successfully improves the long-term temporal consistency in
the video results. The PP loss is effective by offering valid information in forward as well as backward passes of image sequences. This
concept is also used in robotic control algorithms, where reversed
trajectories starting from goal positions have been used as training
data [Nair et al. 2018].

3 LEARNING TEMPORALLY COHERENT CONDITIONAL
VIDEO GENERATION
We first propose the concepts of temporal self-supervision for GANbased video generation (Sec. 3.1 and Sec. 3.2), before introducing
solutions for VSR and UVT tasks (Sec. 3.3 and Sec. 3.4) as example
applications.

generation. Thus, we propose an algorithm for spatio-temporal
adversarial learning that is easy to integrate into existing GANbased image generation approaches. Starting from a standard GAN
for images, as shown in Fig. 2 a), we propose to use a frame-recurrent
generator (b) together with a spatio-temporal discriminator (c).
As shown in Fig. 2 b), our generator produces an output 𝑔𝑡 from an
input frame 𝑎𝑡 and recursively uses the previously generated output
𝑔𝑡 −1 . Following previous work [Sajjadi et al. 2018], we warp this
frame-recurrent input to align it with the current frame. This allows
the network to more easily re-use previously generated details. The
high-level structure of the generator can be summarized as:
𝑣𝑡 = F(𝑎𝑡 −1, 𝑎𝑡 ),

𝑔𝑡 = G(𝑎𝑡 ,𝑊 (𝑔𝑡 −1, 𝑣𝑡 )).

(1)

Here, the network 𝐹 is trained to estimate the motion 𝑣𝑡 from frame
𝑎𝑡 −1 to 𝑎𝑡 and 𝑊 denotes warping.
The central building block of our approach is a novel spatiotemporal discriminator 𝐷𝑠,𝑡 that receives triplets of frames, shown
in Fig. 2 c). This contrasts with typically used spatial discriminators that supervise only a single image. By concatenating multiple
adjacent frames along the channel dimension, the frame triplets
form an important building block for learning as they can provide
networks with gradient information regarding the realism of spatial
structures as well as short-term temporal information, such as firstand second-order time derivatives.
We propose a 𝐷𝑠,𝑡 architecture that primarily receives two types
of triplets: three adjacent frames and the corresponding warped
ones. We warp later frames backward and previous ones forward.
The network 𝐹 is likewise used to estimate the corresponding motions. While original frames contain the full spatio-temporal information, warped frames more easily yield temporal information
with their aligned content. For the input variants we use the following notations: I𝑔 = {𝑔𝑡 −1, 𝑔𝑡 , 𝑔𝑡 +1 }, I𝑏 = {𝑏𝑡 −1, 𝑏𝑡 , 𝑏𝑡 +1 }; I𝑤𝑔 =
{𝑊 (𝑔𝑡 −1, 𝑣𝑡 ), 𝑔𝑡 ,𝑊 (𝑔𝑡 +1, 𝑣𝑡′ )}, I𝑤𝑏 = {𝑊 (𝑏𝑡 −1, 𝑣𝑡 ), 𝑏𝑡 ,𝑊 (𝑏𝑡 +1, 𝑣𝑡′ )}.
A subscript 𝑎 denotes the input domain, while the 𝑏 subscript denotes the target domain. The quotation mark in 𝑣 ′ indicates that
quantities are estimated from the backward direction.
Although the proposed concatenation of several frames seems
like a simple change that has been used in a variety of other contexts, we show that it represents an important operation that allows
discriminators to understand spatio-temporal data distributions. As
will be shown below, it can effectively reduce temporal problems
encountered by spatial GANs. While 𝐿 2 −based temporal losses are
widely used in the field of video generation, the spatio-temporal
adversarial loss is crucial for preventing the inference of blurred
structures in multi-modal data-sets. Compared to GANs using multiple discriminators, the single 𝐷𝑠,𝑡 network that we propose can
learn to balance the spatial and temporal aspects according to the
reference data and avoid inconsistent sharpness as well as overly
smooth results. Additionally, by extracting shared spatio-temporal
features, it allows for smaller network sizes.

3.2

Self-Supervision for Long-term Temporal Consistency

When relying on a previous output as input, i.e., for frame-recurrent
architectures, generated structures easily accumulate frame by frame.
In adversarial training, generators learn to heavily rely on previously generated frames and can easily converge towards strongly

reinforcing spatial features over longer periods of time. For videos,
this especially occurs along directions of motion and these solutions
can be seen as a special form of temporal mode collapse, where
the training converges to a mostly constant temporal signal as a
sub-optimal, trivial equilibrium. We have noticed this issue in a
variety of recurrent architectures, examples are shown in Fig. 3 a)
and the Dst version in Fig. 8.
While this issue could be alleviated by training with longer sequences, it is computationally expensive and can fail for even longer
sequences, as shown in Appendix D. We generally want generators
to be able to work with sequences of arbitrary length for inference.
To address this inherent problem of recurrent generators, we propose a new bi-directional “Ping-Pong” loss. For natural videos, a
sequence with the forward order as well as its reversed counterpart
offer valid information. Thus, from any input of length 𝑛, we can construct a symmetric PP sequence in form of 𝑎 1, ...𝑎𝑛−1, 𝑎𝑛 , 𝑎𝑛−1, ...𝑎 1
as shown in Fig. 3 c). When inferring this in a frame-recurrent manner, the generated result should not strengthen any invalid features
from frame to frame. Rather, the result should stay close to valid
information and be symmetric, i.e., the forward result 𝑔𝑡 = 𝐺 (𝑎𝑡 ,
𝑔𝑡 −1 ) and the one generated from the reversed part, 𝑔𝑡′ = 𝐺 (𝑎𝑡 , 𝑔𝑡′ +1 ) ,
should be identical.
Based on this observation, we train our networks with extended
PP sequences and constrain the generated outputs from both “legs”

in contrast to the generator loss, the 𝐿 norm is a correct choice
here: We are not faced with multi-modal data where an 𝐿 2 norm
would lead to undesirable averaging, but rather aim to constrain the
recurrent generator to its own, unique version over time without
favoring smoothness. The PP terms provide constraints for short
term consistency via ∥𝑔𝑛−1 − 𝑔𝑛−1 ′ ∥ 2 , while terms such as ∥𝑔1 − 𝑔1 ′ ∥ 2
prevent long-term drifts of the results. This bi-directional loss

formulation also helps to constrain ambiguities due to disocclusions
that can occur in regular training scenarios.
As shown in Fig. 3 b), the PP loss successfully removes drifting
artifacts while appropriate high-frequency details are preserved. In
addition, it effectively extends the training data set, and as such
represents a useful form of data augmentation. A comparison is
given in Appendix D to disentangle the effects of the augmentation
of PP sequences and the temporal constraints. The results show that
the temporal constraint is the key to reliably suppressing the temporal accumulation of artifacts, achieving consistency, and allowing
models to infer much longer sequences than seen during training.
The majority of related work for video generation focuses on
network architectures. Being orthogonal to architecture improvements, our work explores temporal self-supervision. The proposed
spatio-temporal discriminator and the PP loss can be used in video
generation tasks to replace simple temporal losses, e.g. the ones
based on 𝐿 2 differences and warping. In the following subsections,
solutions for VSR and UVT are presented as examples in paired and
unpaired data domains.

3.3

Network Architecture for VSR

For video super-resolution (VSR) tasks, the input domain contains
LR frames while the target domain contains high-resolution (HR)
videos with more complex details and motions. Since one pattern
in low-resolution can correspond to multiple structures in highresolution, VSR represents a multimodal problem that benefits from
adversarial training. In the proposed spatio-temproal adversarial
training, we use a ResNet architecture for the VSR generator G.
Similar to previous work, an encoder-decoder structure is applied
to 𝐹 for motion estimation. We intentionally keep the generative
part simple and in line with previous work, in order to demonstrate
the advantages of the temporal self-supervision.
The VSR discriminator 𝐷𝑠,𝑡 should guide the generator to learn
the correlation between the conditional LR inputs and HR targets.
Therefore, three LR frames I𝑎 = {𝑎𝑡 −1, 𝑎𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 +1 } from the input
domain are used as a conditional input. The input of 𝐷𝑠,𝑡 can be
summarized as I𝑏𝑠,𝑡 = {I𝑏 , I𝑤𝑏 , I𝑎 } labelled as real and the generated
𝑔
inputs I𝑠,𝑡 = {I𝑔 , I𝑤𝑔 , I𝑎 } labelled as fake, as shown in Fig. 4. We
concatenate all triplets together. In this way, the conditional 𝐷𝑠,𝑡
will penalize 𝐺 if I𝑔 contains less spatial details or unrealistic artifacts
in comparison to I𝑎 , I𝑏 . At the same time, temporal relationships

between the generated images I𝑤𝑔 and those of the ground truth
I𝑤𝑏 should match. With our setup, the discriminator profits from the
warped frames to classify realistic and unnatural temporal changes,
and for situations where the motion estimation is less accurate, the
discriminator can fall back to the original, i.e. not warped, images.

3.4

Network Architecture for UVT

While one generator is enough to map data from A to B for tasks
such as VSR, unpaired generation tasks require a second generator
to establish cycle consistency [Zhu et al. 2017]. For the UVT task, we
use two recurrent generators, mapping from domain A to B and back.
As shown in Fig. 5 a), given 𝑔𝑡𝑎→𝑏 = Gab (𝑎𝑡 ,𝑊 (𝑔𝑡𝑎→𝑏
−1 , 𝑣 𝑡 )), we can
use 𝑎𝑡 as the labeled data of 𝑔𝑡𝑎→𝑏→𝑎 = Gba (𝑔𝑡𝑎→𝑏 ,𝑊 (𝑔𝑡𝑎→𝑏→𝑎
, 𝑣𝑡 ))
−1
to enforce consistency. An encoder-decoder structure is applied to
UVT generators and 𝐹 .
In UVT tasks, we demonstrate that the temporal cycle-consistency
between different domains can be established using the supervision
of unconditional spatio-temporal discriminators. This is in contrast
to previous work which focuses on the generative networks to form
spatio-temporal cycle links. Our approach actually yields improved
results, as we will show below. In practice, we found it crucial to
ensure that generators first learn reasonable spatial features, and
only then improve their temporal correlation. Therefore, different
to the 𝐷𝑠,𝑡 of VST that always receives 3 concatenated triplets as
an input, the unconditional 𝐷𝑠,𝑡 of UVT only takes one triplet at a
time. Focusing on the generated data, the input for a single batch
can either be a static triplet of I𝑠𝑔 = {𝑔𝑡 , 𝑔𝑡 , 𝑔𝑡 }, the warped triplet
I𝑤𝑔 , or the original triplet I𝑔 . The same holds for the reference data
of the target domain, as shown in Fig. 4 b). Here, the warping is
again performed via 𝐹 . With sufficient but complex information
contained in these triplets, transition techniques are applied so that
the network can consider the spatio-temporal information step by
step, i.e., we initially start with 100% static triplets I𝑠𝑔 as the input.
Then, over the course of training, 25% of them transit to I𝑤𝑔 triplets
with simpler temporal information, with another 25% transition to I𝑔
afterwards, leading to a (50%,25%,25%) distribution of triplets. Details
of the transition calculations are given in Appendix C. Sample
triplets are visualized in the supplemental web-page (Sec. 7).
While non-adversarial training typically employs loss formulations with static goals, the GAN training yields dynamic goals due
to discriminators discovering learning objectives over the course

of the training run. Therefore, their inputs have a strong influence
on the training process and the final results. Modifying the inputs
in a controlled manner can lead to different results and substantial
improvements if done correctly, as will be shown in Sec. 4.

3.5

Loss Functions

Perceptual Loss Terms. As perceptual metrics, both pre-trained
NNs [Johnson et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2018b] and GAN discriminators [Xie et al. 2018] were successfully used in previous work.
Here, we use feature maps from a pre-trained VGG-19 network [Simonyan and Zisserman 2014], as well as 𝐷𝑠,𝑡 itself. In the VSR
task, we can encourage the generator to produce features similar to
the ground truth ones by increasing the cosine similarity of their
feature maps. In UVT tasks without paired ground truth data, the
generators should match the distribution of features in the target
domain. Similar to a style loss for traditional style transfer tasks
[Johnson et al. 2016], we thus compute the 𝐷𝑠,𝑡 feature correlations
measured by the Gram matrix for UVT tasks. The 𝐷𝑠,𝑡 features contain both spatial and temporal information and hence are especially
well suited for the perceptual loss.
Loss and Training Summary . We now explain how to integrate
the spatio-temporal discriminator into the paired and unpaired tasks.
We use a standard discriminator loss for the 𝐷𝑠,𝑡 of VSR and a leastsquare discriminator loss for the 𝐷𝑠,𝑡 of UVT. Correspondingly, a
non-saturated L𝑎𝑑𝑣 is used for the 𝐺 and 𝐹 of VSR and a leastsquares one is used for the UVT generators. As summarized in
Table 1, 𝐺 and 𝐹 are trained with the mean squared loss Lcontent ,
adversarial losses L𝑎𝑑𝑣 , perceptual losses L𝜙 , the PP loss LPP ,
and a warping loss Lwarp , where again 𝑔, 𝑏 and Φ stand for generated
samples, ground truth images and feature maps of VGG or 𝐷𝑠,𝑡 . We
only show losses for the mapping from A to B for UVT tasks, as
the backward mapping simply mirrors the terms. We refer to our
full model for both tasks as TecoGAN below. The UVT data-sets
are obtained from previous work [Bansal et al. 2018] and each data
domain has around 2400 to 3600 unpaired frames. For VSR, we
download 250 short videos with 120 frames each from Vimeo.com.
In line with other VSR projects, we down-sample these frames by
a factor of 2 to get the ground-truth HR frames. Corresponding
LR frames are achieved by applying a Gaussian blur and sampling
every fourth pixel. A Gaussian blur step is important to mimic the
information loss due to the camera sensibility in a real-life capturing
scenario. Although the information loss is complex and not unified,
a Gaussian kernel with a standard deviation of 1.5 is commonly
used for a super-resolution factor of 4. Training parameters and
details are given in Appendix F.

ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION OF LEARNING
OBJECTIVES

In the following section, we illustrate the effects of temporal supervision using two ablation studies. In the first one, models trained with
ablated loss functions show how Ladv and LPP change the overall
learning objectives. Next, full UVT models are trained with different
𝐷𝑠,𝑡 inputs. This highlights how differently the corresponding discriminators converge to different spatio-temporal equilibriums and
the general importance of providing suitable data distributions from

Loss Ablation Study

Below we compare variants of our full TecoGAN model to EnhanceNet (ENet) [Sajjadi et al. 2017], FRVSR [Sajjadi et al. 2018],
and DUF [Jo et al. 2018] for VSR. CycleGAN [Zhu et al. 2017] and
RecycleGAN [Bansal et al. 2018] are compared for UVT. Specifically,
ENet and CycleGAN represent state-of-the-art single-image adversarial models without temporal information, FRVSR and DUF are
state-of-the-art VSR methods without adversarial losses, and RecycleGAN is a spatial adversarial model with a prediction network
learning the temporal evolution.
Video Super-Resolution. For VSR, we first train a DsOnly model
that uses a frame-recurrent 𝐺 and 𝐹 with a VGG loss and only the
regular spatial discriminator. Compared to ENet, which exhibits
strong incoherence due to the lack of temporal information, DsOnly

Fig. 8. When learning a mapping between Trump and Obama, the CycleGAN model gives good spatial features but collapses to essentially static outputs of Obama. It manages to
transfer facial expressions back to Trump using tiny differences encoded in its Obama outputs, without understanding the cycle-consistency between the two domains. Being able to
establish the correct temporal cycle-consistency between domains, ours, RecycleGAN and STC-V2V can generate correct blinking motions, shown in Sec. 4.7 of the supplemental
web-page. Our model outperforms the latter two in terms of coherent detail that is generated. Obama and Trump video courtesy of the White House (public domain).

improves temporal coherence thanks to the frame-recurrent connection, but there are noticeable high-frequency changes between
frames. The temporal profiles of DsOnly in Fig. 6 and 7, correspondingly contain sharp and broken lines.
When adding a temporal discriminator in addition to the spatial one (DsDt), this version generates more coherent results, and
its temporal profiles are sharp and coherent. However, DsDt often
produces the drifting artifacts discussed in Sec. 3, as the generator
learns to reinforce existing details from previous frames to fool 𝐷𝑠
with sharpness, and satisfying 𝐷𝑡 with good temporal coherence in
the form of persistent detail. While this strategy works for generating short sequences during training, the strengthening effect can
lead to very undesirable artifacts for long-sequence inferences.
By adding the self-supervision for long-term temporal consistency L𝑝𝑝 , we arrive at the DsDtPP model, which effectively suppresses these drifting artifacts with an improved temporal coherence.
In Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, DsDtPP results in continuous yet detailed temporal profiles without streaks from temporal drifting. Although DsDtPP generates good results, it is difficult in practice to balance the
generator and the two discriminators. The results shown here were
achieved only after numerous runs manually tuning the weights of
the different loss terms. By using the proposed 𝐷𝑠,𝑡 discriminator
instead, we get a first complete model for our method, denoted
as TecoGAN⊖ . This network is trained with a discriminator that
achieves an excellent quality with an effectively halved network
size, as illustrated on the right of Fig. 14. The single discriminator correspondingly leads to a significant reduction in resource

usage. Using two discriminators requires ca. 70% more GPU memory, and leads to a reduced training performance by ca. 20%. The
TecoGAN⊖ model yields similar perceptual and temporal quality to
DsDtPP with a significantly faster and more stable training.
Since the TecoGAN⊖ model requires less training resources, we
also trained a larger generator with 50% more weights. In the following, we will focus on this larger single-discriminator architecture
with PP loss as our full TecoGAN model for VSR. Compared to the
TecoGAN⊖ model, it can generate more details, and the training
process is more stable, indicating that the larger generator and 𝐷𝑠,𝑡
are more evenly balanced. Result images and temporal profiles are
shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7. Video results are shown in Sec. 4 of the
supplemental web-page.
Unpaired Video Translation. We carry out a similar ablation study
for the UVT task. Again, we start from a single-image GAN-based
model, a CycleGAN variant which already has two pairs of spatial
generators and discriminators. Then, we train the DsOnly variant by
adding flow estimation via 𝐹 and extending the spatial generators
to frame-recurrent ones. By augmenting the two discriminators to
use the triplet inputs proposed in Sec. 3, we arrive at the Dst model
with spatio-temporal discriminators, which does not yet use the PP
loss. By adding the PP loss we complete the TecoGAN model for
UVT. Although UVT tasks substantially differ from VSR tasks, the
comparisons in Fig. 8 and Sec. 4.7 of our supplemental web-page
illustrate that UVT tasks profit from the proposed approach in a
very similar manner to VSR.

We use renderings of 3D fluid simulations of rising smoke as
our unpaired training data. These simulations are generated with
randomized numerical simulations using a resolution of 643 for
domain A and 2563 for domain B, and both are visualized with
images of size 2562 . Therefore, video translation from domain A to
B is a tough task, as the latter contains significantly more turbulent
and small-scale motions. With no temporal information available,
the CycleGAN variant generates HR smoke that strongly flickers.
The DsOnly model offers better temporal coherence by relying on
its frame-recurrent input, but it learns a solution that largely ignores
the current input and fails to keep reasonable spatio-temporal cycleconsistency links between the two domains. On the contrary, our
𝐷𝑠,𝑡 enables the Dst model to learn the correlation between the
spatial and temporal aspects, thus improving the cycle-consistency.
However, without L𝑝𝑝 , the Dst model (like the DsDt model of VSR)
reinforces detail over time in an undesirable way. This manifests
itself as inappropriate smoke density in empty regions. Using our
full TecoGAN model which includes L𝑝𝑝 , yields the best results,
with detailed smoke structures and very good spatio-temporal cycleconsistency.
For comparison, a DsDtPP model with a larger number of networks, i.e. four discriminators, two frame-recurrent generators and
the 𝐹 , is trained. By weighting the temporal adversarial losses from
Dt with 0.3 and the spatial ones from Ds with 0.5, we arrived at
a balanced training run. Although this model performs similarly
to the TecoGAN model on the smoke dataset, the proposed spatiotemporal 𝐷𝑠,𝑡 architecture represents a more preferable choice in
practice, as it learns a natural balance of temporal and spatial components by itself, and requires fewer resources. Continuing along
this direction, it will be interesting future work to evaluate variants,
such as a shared 𝐷𝑠,𝑡 for both domains, i.e. a multi-class classifier
network. Besides the smoke dataset, an ablation study for the Obama
and Trump dataset from Fig. 8 shows a very similar behavior, as can
be seen in the supplemental web-page (Sec. 4.7).

4.2

Spatio-temporal Adversarial Equilibriums

Our evaluation so far highlights that temporal adversarial learning
is crucial for achieving spatial detail that is coherent over time for
VSR, and for enabling the generators to learn the spatio-temporal
correlation between domains in UVT. Next, we will shed light on the
complex spatio-temporal adversarial learning objectives by varying the information provided to the discriminator network. In the
following tests, shown in Fig. 9 and Sec. 5 of the supplemental document, 𝐷𝑠,𝑡 networks are identical apart from changing inputs, and
we focus on the smoke dataset.
In order to learn the spatial and temporal features of the target domain as well as their correlation, the simplest input for 𝐷𝑠,𝑡 consists
of only the original, unwarped triplets, i.e. {I𝑔 or I𝑏 }. Using these, we
train a baseline model, which yields a sub-optimal quality: it lacks
sharp spatial structures and contains coherent but dull motions.
Despite containing the full information, these input triplets prevent
𝐷𝑠,𝑡 from providing the desired supervision. For paired video translation tasks, the vid2vid network achieves improved temporal coherence by using a video discriminator to supervise the output sequence
conditioned with the ground-truth motion. With no ground-truth
ACM Trans. Graph., Vol. 39, No. 4, Article 75. Publication date: July 2020.

data available, we train a vid2vid variant by using the estimated
motions and original triplets, i.e {I𝑔 + 𝐹 (𝑔𝑡 −1, 𝑔𝑡 ) + 𝐹 (𝑔𝑡 +1, 𝑔𝑡 ) or
I𝑏 + 𝐹 (𝑏𝑡 −1, 𝑏𝑡 ) + 𝐹 (𝑏𝑡 +1, 𝑏𝑡 )}, as the input for 𝐷𝑠,𝑡 . However, the
result do not significantly improve. The motions are only partially
reliable, and hence don’t help for the difficult unpaired translation
task. Therefore, the discriminator still fails to fully correlate spatial
and temporal features.
We then train a third model, concat, using the original triplets and
the warped ones, i.e. {I𝑔 + I𝑤𝑔 or I𝑏 + I𝑤𝑏 }. In this case, the model
learns to generate more spatial details with a more vivid motion.
I.e., the improved temporal information from the warped triplets
gives the discriminator important cues. However, the motion still
does not fully resemble the target domain. We arrive at our final
TecoGAN model for UVT by controlling the composition of the input

Fig. 9. Adversarial training arrives at different equilibriums when discriminators use different inputs. The baseline model (supervised on original
triplets) and the vid2vid variant (supervised on original triplets and estimated motions) fail to learn the complex temporal dynamics of a highresolution smoke. The warped triplets improve the result of the concat model
and the full TecoGAN model performs better spatio-temporally. Video comparisons are shown in Sec 5. of the supplemental web-page.

data: as outlined above, we first provide only static triplets {I𝑠𝑔 or
I𝑠𝑏 }, and then apply the transitions of warped triplets {I𝑤𝑔 or I𝑤𝑏 },
and original triplets {I𝑔 or I𝑏 } over the course of training. In this
way, the network can first learn to extract spatial features and build
on them to establish temporal features. Finally, discriminators learn
features about the correlation of spatial and temporal content by
analyzing the original triplets and provide gradients such that the
generators learn to use the motion information from the input and
establish a correlation between the motions in the two unpaired
domains. Consequently, the discriminator, despite receiving only a
single triplet at once, can guide the generator to produce detailed
structures that move coherently.

RESULTS AND METRIC EVALUATION

For the VSR task, we test our model on a wide range of video data,
including the widely used Vid4 dataset shown in Fig. 6, 7 and 12,
detailed scenes from the movie Tears of Steel (ToS) [2011] shown in
Fig. 12, and others shown in Fig. 11. Besides ENet, FRVSR and DUF as
baselines, we further compare our TecoGAN model to RBPN [Haris
et al. 2019] and EDVR [Wang et al. 2019a]. Note that in contrast
to TecoGAN with 3 million trainable weights, the latter two use
substantially larger networks which have more than 12 and 20
million weights respectively, and EDVR is trained using bi-cubic
down-sampling. Thus, in the following quantitative and qualitative
comparisons, results and metrics for EDVR are calculated using
bi-cubic down-sampled images, while other models use LR inputs
with a Gaussian blur. In the supplemental web-page, Sec. 2 contains
video results for the stills shown in Fig. 11, while Sec. 3 shows video
comparisons of Vid4 scenes.
Trained with down-sampled inputs with Gaussian blur, the VSR
TecoGAN model can similarly work with original images that were
not down-sampled or filtered, such as a data-set of real-world photos.
In Fig. 13, we compared our results to two other methods [Liao et al.
2015; Tao et al. 2017] that have used the same dataset. With the help
of adversarial learning, our model is able to generate improved and
realistic details in down-sampled images as well as captured images.
For UVT tasks, we train models for Obama and Trump translations, LR- and HR- smoke simulation translations, as well as translations between smoke simulations and real-smoke captures. While
smoke simulations usually contain strong numerical viscosity with
details limited by the simulation resolution, the real smoke from
Eckert et al. [2018] contains vivid motions with many vortices and
high-frequency details. As shown in Fig. 10, our method can be used
to narrow the gap between simulations and real-world phenomena.
While visual results discussed above provide a first indicator of the
quality our approach achieves, quantitative evaluations are crucial
for automated evaluations across larger numbers of samples. Below
we focus more on the VSR task as ground-truth data is available. We
conduct user studies and present evaluations of the different models
w.r.t. established spatial metrics. We also motivate and propose two
novel temporal metrics to quantify temporal coherence.
For evaluating image SR, Blau and Michaeli [2018] demonstrated
that there is an inherent trade-off between the perceptual quality of
the result and the distortion measured with vector norms or lowlevel structures such as PSNR and SSIM. On the other hand, metrics

based on deep feature maps such as LPIPS [Zhang et al. 2018] can
capture more semantic similarities. We measure the PSNR and LPIPS
using the Vid4 scenes. With a PSNR decrease of less than 2dB over
DUF (which has twice the model size), the LPIPS score of TecoGAN
shows an improvement of more than 40%. The other baselines are
outperformed by similar margins. Even compared to the large EDVR
model using down-sampled inputs without Gaussian blur, TecoGAN
still yields a 30% improvement in terms of LPIPS.

2017], can be easily deceived by very blurry results, e.g. bi-cubic
interpolated ones, we propose to use a tandem of two new metrics,
tOF and tLP, to measure the consistence over time. tOF measures
the pixel-wise difference of motions estimated from sequences, and
tLP measures perceptual changes over time using deep feature map:
tOF = ∥𝑂𝐹 (𝑏𝑡 −1 , 𝑏𝑡 ) − 𝑂𝐹 (𝑔𝑡 −1 , 𝑔𝑡 ) ∥ 1
tLP = ∥𝐿𝑃 (𝑏𝑡 −1 , 𝑏𝑡 ) − 𝐿𝑃 (𝑔𝑡 −1 , 𝑔𝑡 ) ∥ 1 .

𝑂𝐹 represents an optical flow estimation with the Farneback [2003]
algorithm and 𝐿𝑃 is the perceptual LPIPS metric. In tLP, the behavior of the reference is also considered, as natural videos exhibit a

certain degree of change over time. In conjunction, both pixel-wise
differences and perceptual changes are crucial for quantifying realistic temporal coherence. While they could be combined into a
single score, we list both measurements separately, as their relative
importance could vary in different application settings.
Our evaluation with these temporal metrics in Table 2 shows
that all temporal adversarial models outperform spatial adversarial
ones and the full TecoGAN model performs very well: With a large
amount of spatial detail, it still achieves good temporal coherence, on
par with non-adversarial methods such as DUF, FRVSR, RBPN and
EDVR. These results are also visualized in Fig. 14. For VSR, we have
confirmed these automated evaluations with several user studies
(details in Appendix B). Across all of them, we find that the majority
of the participants considered the TecoGAN results to be closest to
the ground truth, when comparing to bi-cubic interpolation, ENet,
FRVSR and DUF.
For the UVT tasks, where no ground-truth data is available,
we can still evaluate tOF and tLP metrics by comparing the motion and the perceptual changes of the output data w.r.t. the ones

coherent motion, TecoGAN outperforms CycleGAN and RecycleGAN on the Obama&Trump dataset, as shown in Table 3, although
it is worth pointing out that tOF is less informative in this case, as
the motion in the target domain is not necessarily pixel-wise aligned
with the input. While RecycleGAN uses an L2-based cycle loss that
leads to undesirable smoothing, Park et al. [2019] propose to use
temporal-cycle losses in together with a VGG-based content preserving loss (we will refer to this method as STC-V2V below). While the
evaluation of temporal metrics for TecoGAN and STC-V2V is very
close, Fig. 8 shows that our results contain sharper spatial details,
such as the eyes and eyebrows of Obama as well as the wrinkles of
Trump. This is illustrated in Sec. 2.2 of the supplemental web-page.
Overall, TecoGAN successfully generates spatial details, on par with
CycleGAN. TecoGAN also achieves very good tLP scores thanks
to the supervision of temporal coherence, on par with previous
work [Bansal et al. 2018; Park et al. 2019], despite inferring outputs
with improved spatial complexity.
In line with VSR, a perceptual evaluation by humans in a user
study confirms our metric evaluations for the UVT task. The participants consistently prefer TecoGAN results over CycleGAN and
RecycleGAN. The corresponding scores are given in the right column of Table 3.

DISCUSSION AND LIMITATIONS

In paired as well as unpaired data domains, we have demonstrated
that it is possible to learn stable temporal functions with GANs
thanks to the proposed discriminator architecture and PP loss. We
have shown that this yields coherent and sharp details for VSR
problems that go beyond what can be achieved with direct supervision. In UVT, we have shown that our architecture guides the
training process to successfully establish the spatio-temporal cycle
consistency between two domains. These results are reflected in the
proposed metrics and confirmed by user studies.
While our method generates very realistic results for a wide range
of natural images, our method can lead to temporally coherent yet
sub-optimal details in certain cases such as under-resolved faces
and text in VSR, or UVT tasks with strongly different motion between two domains. For the latter case, it would be interesting to
apply both our method and motion translation from concurrent
work [Chen et al. 2019]. This can make it easier for the generator
to learn from our temporal self-supervision. The proposed temporal self-supervision also has potential to improve other tasks such
as video in-painting and video colorization. In these multi-modal
problems, it is especially important to preserve long-term temporal
consistency. For our method, the interplay of the different loss terms
in the non-linear training procedure does not provide a guarantee
that all goals are fully reached every time. However, we found our
method to be stable over a large number of training runs and we
anticipate that it will provide a very useful basis for a wide range of
generative models for temporal data sets.
