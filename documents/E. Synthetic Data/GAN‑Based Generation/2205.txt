professors who have supported me throughout my education.

Many organizations quickly upgrade their policy to comply
with the legislation and create effective platforms such as
data portals that allow consumers to exercise their privacy
rights. However, on the other hand, we still noticed aspects
of CCPA being absent on some websites. Also, we learned
that there exists a technique that a social media company may
use to minimize the effect of CCPA on their data collecting
businesses. Additionally, we found no prior evaluation of
the CCPA implementation in organizations. Therefore, the
convergence of the regulatory landscape and the organization’s

privacy policy needs to be studied. For example, it is feasible to measure consumers’ effortlessness in exercising their
privacy rights. In addition, when exercising data rights, how
challenging consumers may have must be assessed.

C. Company Websites Covered In The Research

Personal information is: Name, social security number, email
addresses, records of products purchased, internet browsing
history, geo-location data, fingerprints, and inferences.

following categories: social media, e-commerce, financial institution, health care, and mortgage companies. First, we

D. Web Crawler
The primary technology we used to implement the features
is web crawling, Java Selenium. Web crawling is a technology
that indexes information on the page using bots known as
crawlers. Crawling is similar to what search engines do that
will see a web page as a whole and index it. When a
bot crawls a website, it goes through every page and link
until it reaches the last component of the website. Thus, we
used a web crawler to detect text fields related to CCPA
criteria; then, we piped the crawled data through some business
logic components to determine whether the website complies
with CCPA. After that, the front-end user interface employed
the modern JavaScript framework VueJS [10] to render and
present the result to consumers.

on a company’s website.
2) Cookiebot: Cookiebot is a free trial tool [12] to retrieve
a report about which data a website is collecting and which
third parties they share the data with. The logic behind this tool
is to inspect cookies or trackers used by a web browser when
visiting a website. Cookies can expose the type of data and the
party responsible for that data collecting. A free trial account
can scan up to 1 domain and 100 sub-pages. The premium
account can browse from $10 to $41 per domain from 500 to
5000 sub-pages.
Limitations: This application scans the cookies to determine the collected data and related parties. However, about
CCPA compliance checking, this application does not have
a feature to verify CCPA criteria. Notably, it cannot check
for collection notice and consumer data rights. In addition,

the outcome would depend solely on inspecting the website’s
privacy notice - the CCPA section that companies post on their
websites. For that reason, we could not verify some criteria
related to internal company processes from our end, such as
questions about if the company has trained its employees about
CCPA.
1) Social Media and E-Commerce: Based on a ranking
report of websites [13], we retrieved a list of the most popular
social media websites to perform CCPA checking. These
websites are ranked based on the number of page visits.
We figured out that all these social websites in this research
provided users with platforms for consumers to exercise their
rights to access or delete data. However, none of these websites
allow users to opt-out data selling because they claim that they
do not sell user data. The experiment which requests to access
data from these websites gives us our collected data in JSON
format[14]. JSON is portable so that users can port their data
to other platforms. [15][16][17].
We noticed that these websites were missing data collection
notices which should be shown when consumers visit those
websites. As a result, these websites do not inform users
if their data has been collected unless consumers go to the
privacy notice page. As one of the CCPA requirements,
organizations should immediately notify consumers if the
website contains their data. The following is the outcome
of reviewing the CCPA privacy notice on the experimental
websites using the CCPA criteria table.

2) Financial Institution: The financial institution included
in this research Bank Of America (BoA) [18], Wells Fargo
[19], Chase [20] . We only had access to BoA and Chase data
portals with our bank accounts. For Wells Fargo, because we
do not have an account with them, the review result is solely
based on examining the bank privacy notice. We made a data
access request to BoA and Chase, but only Chase gave us the
data report. BoA did not fulfill our request because our account
falls under a consumer account. They claimed that consumer
account is exempted from CCPA. Detail of the BoA response
is included in the next paper section. BoA might use an
exemption of CCPA under Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)
[21]. CCPA does not generally apply to personal information
collected, processed, sold, or disclosed pursuant to the federal
or its implementing regulations. Although data regulated by
the GLBA is not generally subject to the CCPA, CCPA still
applies to this data with respect to consumers’ private of
action. For example, the CCPA allows California residents to
sue an organization if certain data elements are not encrypted
when a data breach occurs. On both Bank Of America and
Chase websites, no collection notice was available when we
visited their homepage.

mortgage companies for CCPA implementation. Three of the
largest mortgage companies, Quicken Loans [22], UWM [23],
and Freedom Mortgage [24], all mention CCPA on their
websites. However, there was no notice of collection when
visiting the website. In addition, we do not have accounts to
test accessing/deleting data requests. We generated the results

websites.

5) Academic Institution : This section is about the evaluation of CCPA in an educational institution. We know that
colleges and universities possess students’ and staff’s sensitive data that may be entitled to consumers’ privacy rights.
Therefore, we chose California State Polytechnic University,
Pomona (CPP), to perform CCPA research on their website.
Generally, the CCPA is interpreted not to cover colleges
and universities because they are often considered non-profit
entities [30]. For that reason, the CCPA notice is absent
on CPP’s website. However, CPP is proactive in protecting
user data by having a well-written online privacy notice that
overlaps many CCPA requirements [31]. Therefore, we rate
the non-CCPA privacy notice that CPP currently posts on its
website as a suitable substitution for CCPA privacy because
of its comprehension.
Following that, CPP states that they collect and process
personal information such as the user’s name, social security
number, physical address, financial matter, and additional
user-provided information. In the notice, CPP also explains
how they use the information we collect. Some purposes
include application, registration, service request processing,
and fraudulent detection. In addition, CPP confirms that they
do not collect personally identifiable information about users’
online activities across third-party websites. Finally, CPP informs that they train their staff on procedures for managing
personal information. Although CCPA does not cover CPP, the
university still allows users to perform reviewing, updating and
making changes to the personal information that the university
maintains. Following that, we still use the criteria table to
compare the privacy notice on their website with CCPA to see
their perspective on handling users’ data.

B. High Level Flow Diagram
1) Introduction: This section explains the flow of the
data with high-level architecture. We have divided our web
application into different layers, and each of them handles
the data flow in our application. Our application consists of
six layers: UI, Router, Data Handler, and Service. Each of
these layers takes a request and return a variety of response
depending on the given request. A layer communicates directly
with its surrounded layers only to lower the complexity level of
our web application. We will explain the behavior of each layer
in detail later. In addition to those layers, some layers affect

allowing only US IP addresses to access our website. Then it
may help put the website out of the radar of hackers outside

C. Low-Level Designs
This section includes diagrams showing the data flow
through the feature and its error handling charts. These diagrams explain the features we are currently building and the
mistakes in certain areas.
1) CCPA Verifier: This design will show the data flow of
the CCPA Verifying feature. Two scenarios may happen when
executing the CCPA verifier. In the first scenario, if a CCPA
privacy notice is found on the tested website, the application
will perform additional functions such as checking for the right
to access, delete, and opt-out. Then the application will return
a link to the CCPA page of the website, where consumers
can exercise their CCPA rights. In the second scenario, if the
application cannot find any information related to CCPA on
the tested website, it will allow consumers to download a
screenshot of a website and then instruct consumers to file
a complaint to the Office of Attorney General.

VI. P ROJECT I MPLEMENTATION - CCPA V ERIFIER 1.0
A. Backend application
The backend server is written in Java and follows using a
micro-services pattern. The application is constructed by four
major java packages: Main application file, controller package,
manager package, model package, and service package. The
below figure describes how we structure our application.

which require a hybrid data crawling solution (manual direct
the application which pages to crawl data first), we can
extend the generic CCPA service to create a website-specific
version of CCPA service. For example, we can create a CCPA
service named ChaseCPPAService that specifically contains
crawling functions working with the Chase website. To write
an extended function is simple; we only need to input a URL
that points to the site’s CCPA privacy page directly to skip
the automatic CCPA searching process that the generic CCPA
function does. That approach would ensure the application can
always reach the CCPA privacy page even if the website has
a complex structure. After that, the rest of the process can
still be automated by the generic CCPA module. We usually
do not need to override the CCPA criteria look-up functions
in most cases. Currently, our application service package
contains the following classes: GenericCCPAService class,
GoogleCCPAService, FacebookCCPAService, and ChaseService. We will add more classes to the application as the
application needs to check more websites. We believe this
project would benefit our community in the long term, so we
aim to maximize the reusability and make the application more
maintainable.
Next, the manager package combines standalone services
to satisfy application business requirements. For example,
when consumers perform CCPA checking on a website, the

for a privacy notice first, then CCPA notice, then right to

ready to transfer to a front-end application.
The last package in our application is the controller package.
It is the gateway that the backend application receives web
requests from a front-end application. The data is served under
JSON format. To request data, the front-end application will
send a REST request to the endpoint with the website URL as
the request parameter. For performance, every CCPA criteria
checking would be performed using a single REST request,
so we only have two API endpoints now. One is used for the
CCPA checking, and the other one is used to retrieve browser
screenshots for the front end.

1) Landing Page: The landing page is the first location
consumers will experience when visiting the website. The
landing page also includes other nested pages because of
the nature of a single-page application (SPA). Therefore, that
beauty is to allow consumers to scroll down to discover more
website content without being redirected to other pages. In
addition, SPA will enable consumers to take less time to
understand the website structure. Only the feature page on
which consumers perform CCPA checking on other websites

utilize UI blocks and cards to highlight important information
and support assistive technology. We also embed a link that

developmental stage.

VII. CCPA V ERIFIER - F EATURE F LOW
The following is the flow of the CCPA verifier feature. This
section will present what a consumer has to do to verify CCPA
on a website using our application. Again, the application is
fully functional at www.ccpaverifier.com.
First, after entering the homepage, consumers click on the
feature button to go to the application feature page.
Fig. 19: Website selection for CCPA verifying

As soon as consumers click the check button, the application
will start CCPA verifying process. It takes approximately thirty
seconds to one minute to receive a result. The pending state
is as shown in the below figure. In this state, the front-end
application will send a REST request which includes a website
URL. Then the back-end will call initialize a web crawler
using selenium driver to crawl data from the target website.
As soon as a result is generated, it will be sent back to the UI

If the verifier detects CCPA compliance on a website, it will

We can evaluate the effectiveness of the CCPA checking
tool by comparing the tool’s result with a table of ground
truth values. Ground truth values are the CCPA compliance

result obtained by manually reviewing CCPA notices on
websites. First, we picked popular websites to check their
CCPA compliance manually and then constructed a criteria
table in section 2.1. In the next step, we would use the CCPA
tool to inspect the websites to retrieve the results about their
CCPA compliance automatically. After that, we compared the
application’s result with the ground truth table to measure the
tool’s accuracy. The websites included in the test were the
same websites in the literature review section. Finally, we
tested the tool with websites implemented by different web
technologies for generalization.
The evaluation results showed that the CCPA verifier
worked well with most of the websites on the list. However,
the application got some difficulties navigating the CCPA
notice page on some websites, such as Chase’s website. Still,

business requirement mentioned earlier.
A. False Positive and False Negative Issues
Fundamentally, the business logic behind the CCPA verifier
function utilizes web crawling and natural language processing. To determine if a website complies with CCPA, our

the next version of the application, we will deploy a feature
that allows our application to detect the cookies being used
on a website. Especially some websites now offer users an
option to opt-out of being tracked, which means those websites
