Results of a direct numerical simulation of a ﬁlm cooling jet are used to evaluate the terms in the standard k–"
turbulence model. From the direct numerical simulation data all terms and correlations appearing in the exact k–"
equations are reconstructed and compared with the models for these terms used in the standard k–" turbulence
model. Unlike a channel ﬂow, the turbulent diffusion terms that contain ﬂuctuations of pressure are found to be
signiﬁcant and to have a different distribution from the turbulent diffusion terms involving only velocity ﬂuctuations.
Using an eddy viscosity derived from minimizing the error in representing the direct numerical simulation data by
the Boussinesq gradient approximation, it is shown that the Boussinesq gradient approximation as used in the
standard k–" turbulence model is a reasonable model for the various terms in the exact k–" equations. However, the
expression for the eddy viscosity of the standard k–" turbulence model (C k2 ="Re) is shown to be greatly in error.
Using the direct numerical simulation data, two new damping functions are presented that greatly reduce the error in
the eddy viscosity in the standard k–" turbulence model.

the crossﬂow and underpredicts the jet spreading rate [1]. It is well
known [2] to have difﬁculties in predicting ﬂows with adverse
pressure gradients as occurs in the recirculation region behind a ﬁlm
cooling jet. Despite these difﬁculties, the standard k–" model has
been widely applied to ﬁlm cooling ﬂows as in [1,3,4]. Difﬁculties in
predicting ﬁlm cooling effectiveness at higher blowing ratios were
reported by He et al. [4], and attributed to the failure of the turbulence
model to correctly predict jet penetration. In a combined
experimental and computational work, Ajersch et al. [3] found an
overprediction of the streamwise and vertical velocity. They also
reported signiﬁcantly larger extrema for a Reynolds turbulent shear
stress in the computations as compared to the experiments. An
overprediction of the turbulent kinetic energy was seen in Hoda and
Acharya [1]. An underprediction of lateral ﬁlm cooling effectiveness
(in comparison to experimental data) was found by Berhe and
Patankar [5] and attributed to the underprediction of the lateral
spreading of the jet. Greater jet penetration and a correspondingly
reduced lateral spreading of the jet was found in Berhe and Patankar
[6]. In a computational and experimental study, Harrington et al. [7]
found a signiﬁcant overprediction of jet penetration and a signiﬁcant
underprediction of jet lateral spreading. Using the standard k–"
model Radomsky and Thole [8] found a large overprediction of the
turbulent kinetic energy and one of the Reynolds turbulent shear
stresses for ﬂow in a turbine vane passage. In a series of papers on
ﬁlm cooling ﬂows, Medic and Durbin [9,10] obtained signiﬁcant
improvements in prediction of turbulent kinetic energy and heat
transfer coefﬁcients by the use of limiters in the standard k–" model.
There are very few studies in the literature concerning direct
numerical simulation (DNS) or large eddy simulation (LES) of ﬁlm
cooling ﬂows. An unsteady simulation of a circular jet in crossﬂow
was performed by Hahn and Choi [11] on a 705  161  129 grid
using second-order central difference schemes. The Reynolds
number was 1750 and the blowing ratio was 0.5. The delivery tube
was not modeled in their work, which solved the incompressible
Navier–Stokes equations but not the energy equation. Muldoon and
Acharya [12] used higher-order ﬁnite difference schemes in an
unsteady simulation to study a normally injected ﬁlm cooling jet
which included the ﬂow development in the delivery tube. This work
presented the unsteady interactions of the upstream crossﬂow and
horseshoe vortex system with ﬂow development in the delivery tube,
and showed that this unsteady interaction resulted in a periodic
pulsing of the jet at a Strouhal number of 0.44. An LES of a ﬁlm
cooling jet was done in a series of papers [13–15] which investigated
the inﬂuence of various parameters on the ﬂow physics of square or
rectangular coolant jets issuing normally into the crossﬂow, similar

I. Introduction

T

HE efﬁciency of turbine engines improves as the operating
temperature of the working ﬂuid in the turbine increases. Higher
ﬂuid temperatures in turbines leads to turbine blade failure as a result
of exceeding temperature limits for the turbine blade material. A
common means of cooling turbine blades is ﬁlm cooling, where the
goal is to protect the blade surface from the hot crossﬂow by a ﬁlm of
cooler ﬂuid injected through holes in the blade surface. These ﬁlm
cooling holes must be designed in such a way that the coolant jet
covers and remains near the blade surface and does not excessively
penetrate into the crossﬂow. The ﬁlm cooling jets consume a
signiﬁcant amount of process air and therefore an important design
goal is to maximize the cooling and minimize the mass ﬂow through
the jets. For these reasons it is important to have accurate models for
the ﬂow and associated heat transfer when designing turbine blades.
The most commonly used turbulence model (the standard k–"
model) is well known to have difﬁculty in ﬁlm cooling applications.
This model typically overpredicts the distance the jet penetrates into

MULDOON AND ACHARYA

to the experimental setup of Ajersch et al. [3]. Whereas the reported
DNS/LES studies have shown improvements in predictive
capabilities vs Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes studies, due to
the computational expense of DNS/LES, Reynolds-averaged
Navier–Stokes methods are the predominant industrial design tool
for ﬁlm cooling ﬂows. Therefore, it is important to improve the
turbulence models used in Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes
solutions to improve their predictive capabilities for ﬁlm cooling
ﬂows.
Using DNS data, the terms in the k–" equations have been
examined for a channel ﬂow problem in which mean gradients exist
only in one dimension [16]. These one-dimensional data have been
examined and used to improve the k–" turbulence model [17].
However, for the three-dimensional ﬁlm cooling conﬁguration of
interest here, the authors are not aware of previous work where the
k–" equations were examined with the aid of DNS, and model
improvements proposed.
The purpose of the present work is to show how the terms in the
commonly used standard k–" model behave for the basic jet-incrossﬂow conﬁguration with jet parameters representative of ﬁlm
cooling. This is done by computing (using DNS) the terms in the
exact k and " equations and the standard k–" model. The modeled
terms are then compared with the terms they model in the exact k and
" equations. This comparison shows what parts of the exact k and "
equations are signiﬁcant, along with how well the standard models
for the various terms perform for this type of ﬂow. This study should
provide guidance for turbulence modelers in developing turbulence
models that are designed for ﬁlm cooling jets in crossﬂow. In
addition, a new wall damping function for the eddy viscosity suitable
for ﬁlm cooling ﬂows is presented.
It should be noted that for ﬂows in which DNS data have been used
to analyze the terms in the exact k–" equations, such as a fully
developed channel ﬂow in which mean gradients exist in only one
dimension, presentation of the results is greatly simpliﬁed as all
terms are one-dimensional. For the ﬂow examined in the present
work, mean gradients exist in all three dimensions which greatly
complicates the analysis and presentation of the terms in the k–"
equations. The use of line plots, although offering a direct
quantitative comparison, can be misleading as they only offer a view
in one dimension from a speciﬁc point in the other two dimensions of
a ﬂow which changes greatly in all three dimensions. To clearly
present the three-dimensional aspect of the ﬂow, the authors have
made extensive use of three-dimensional contour plots. Whereas this
makes more difﬁcult quantitative comparisons, it greatly aids the
comparison of three-dimensional distributions.

Calculations are done on a staggered mesh where the discrete
pressure and passive scalar are located at the main grid points and the
velocity components are staggered in their respective directions. A
sixth-order central difference convective scheme with a monotonic
limiter is used along with fourth-order interpolation for the velocity
in the convective terms, e.g., for v in v@u=@y, etc. A fourth-order
central difference scheme is used for the diffusive terms. The
pressure gradient and the continuity equation are represented by
second-order centered schemes. A third-order accurate explicit time
integration scheme is used to integrate the convective and diffusive
terms in time; the pressure gradient is treated fully implicitly. The
equation for the transport of the passive scalar is represented using
the same order and type of schemes used for the momentum
equations. Equations (1) and (2) are solved using the colored
symmetric coupled Gauss Seidel (SCGS) method. The accuracy of
all ﬁnite difference stencils is maintained near nonperiodic
boundaries by shifting toward the boundary the point at which the
stencil is evaluated. Further details of the ﬁnite difference schemes
and the computer code used in the present work can be found in
Muldoon [18].

III. Turbulence Modeling
Any unsteady quantity ut can be decomposed into the following
 where u indicates the time-averaged or
two parts, ut  u0 t  u,
mean part and u0 t the ﬂuctuating part. Throughout this paper the

prime (u0 ) indicates ﬂuctuating quantities whereas the overbar (u)
indicates time-averaged quantities. The Reynolds-averaged Navier–
Stokes equations [Eqs. (4) and (5)] are obtained by time averaging
the Navier–Stokes equations [Eqs. (1) and (2)].

The goal of turbulence modeling is to derive an expression for u0i u0j
and u0j s0 . The Boussinesq gradient approximation Eq. (6), which
requires a deﬁnition for the eddy viscosity, is used in the standard k–"
model and most other two-equation turbulence models to represent
the turbulent Reynolds stresses (u0i u0j ) which appear in the Reynoldsaveraged Navier–Stokes equations [Eqs. (4) and (5)].

II. Governing Equations and Discretization
In the present work, the nonconservative form of the unsteady
incompressible three-dimensional Navier–Stokes equations
[Eqs. (1) and (2)] is used to model the ﬂow, along with an equation
describing the evolution of a passive scalar [Eq. (3)].

Equations (1–3), are solved in nondimensional form, in which the
properties of the ﬂuid and the passive scalar are described by the
Reynolds number and the Prandtl number. These equations are
solved without the use of a model for turbulence, i.e., a DNS is
performed. Solutions are obtained on parallel computer systems
using the computer program Tetra [18] which has been written using
Fortran 95 and MPI for use on high performance parallel computers.

In the standard k–" model, the eddy viscosity is deﬁned as
C k2 ="Re. Equations for k and " can be derived without any
assumptions or simpliﬁcations from the Navier–Stokes equations,
details of which can be found in [2]. As a result of the nonlinearity of
the Navier–Stokes equations, these equations for k and " contain
numerous high-order correlations, which must be modeled. The
present work compares the exact equations for k and " in which these
correlations are determined using DNS with the model for these
correlations given by the standard k–" model of Launder and
Spalding [19]. When comparing the model for the correlations with
the correlations obtained from DNS, all quantities in the model (i.e.,
k, ", and u i ) are obtained from the same DNS. This allows a direct
evaluation of the quality of the model. The DNS is used as a
numerical experiment as it is extremely difﬁcult or impossible to
obtain some of the complicated correlations in the k–" equations
from experimental measurements; therefore this is the only feasible
method with which these correlations can be obtained.

IV.

As the eddy viscosity appears frequently in numerous terms in
two-equation turbulence models including the standard k–" model, it
is examined in detail in the present work. The eddy viscosity can be
computed from Eq. (6) using the results of a DNS to calculate u0i u0j ,
Si;j , and k. It is desired to obtain the value for 1=Re from Eq. (6),
which will minimize the error in representing u0i u0j by the righthand side of Eq. (6). This is done by minimizing the square of the
error with respect to 1=Re . Advantage is not taken of the symmetry
of u0i u0j in deﬁning the error in Eq. (6). The rationale for this is that in
the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations, the off-diagonal
terms appear twice as often as the diagonal. Therefore it is natural to
preserve this ratio in minimizing the error associated with
representing u0i u0j by the Boussinesq gradient approximation
[Eq. (6)].

main grid is chosen for the grid on which Eqs. (7) and (9) are
evaluated, this requires that the velocities be interpolated from their
respective grids onto the main grid. Once this is done the terms in
Eqs. (7) and (9) may be computed. The interpolation and
differentiation operators used for the terms in Eqs. (7) and (9) are
sixth-order accurate. They are derived independently of the operators
used in discretizing Eqs. (1–3). As Eqs. (7) and (9) are derived from
Eqs. (1) and (2) and then discretized on a different grid with operators
different from those used in Eqs. (1) and (2), the residual of Eqs. (7)
and (9) relative to the terms of Eqs. (7) and (9) will likely not be of the
same order as the residual of Eqs. (1) and (2) is relative to the terms of
Eqs. (1) and (2). The alternative would be to derive discretized
versions of Eqs. (7) and (9) directly from the discretized versions of
Eqs. (1) and (2). This would ensure that the residuals of Eqs. (7) and
(9) will be of the same order relative to the terms in the equations as is
the case for Eqs. (1) and (2); however, this is impractical due to the
complexity of the correlations and the high-order discretization
stencils used to discretize Eqs. (1) and (2). Details concerning the
discretization of the exact k and " equations on inﬂow boundaries can
be found in Muldoon [18].

The terms in Eq. (7) and particularly Eq. (9) are extremely
complicated with some containing mixed derivatives. As Eqs. (1)
and (2) are solved on a staggered grid on which all three velocity
components are deﬁned on different grids from each other and from
the main grid where pressure and the scalar are deﬁned, it is necessary
to specify a grid on which to evaluate Eqs. (7) and (9). Because the

Note that as the expression for the error is a quadratic polynomial
in 1=Re , there is a guaranteed global minimum which occurs at the
value of 1=Re given by Eq. (11). It should be noted that this
approach for minimizing the error is different from the traditional
approaches adopted so far where, due to the one nonhomogeneous
dimension in the idealized problems considered, only one
component of u0i u0j and Si;j is important. For more complex threedimensional ﬂows with no homogeneous dimensions, the
aforementioned minimization process appears to be the most logical
approach for computing 1=Re .

Problem Description

The modeled ﬂow is similar to that of Kaszeta [20]. In this
experimental work, an inclined jet with a delivery tube and plenum
was examined. As the goal is to obtain DNS data for a representative
ﬁlm cooling geometry, we decided not to model the plenum and
delivery tube in the DNS. This decision is a result of the stringent
spatial and temporal resolution requirements of DNS. It has been

At the jet exit, the time-averaged results obtained from the
simulation including the plenum and delivery tube are used as the
boundary condition for all three components of the velocity. This
time-averaged velocity should be symmetric about the z-axis.
However, due to the ﬁnite time-averaging period, the proﬁle is not
exactly symmetric. Symmetry is therefore enforced by averaging the
proﬁle around the z-axis. The Reynolds number based on the average
velocity through the jet (Ujet ) and jet diameter is 3068; the Prandtl
number is 0.707. The average blowing ratio, deﬁned as the ratio
Ujet =U0 is 0.24 whereas the blowing ratio based on the maximum jet
exit velocity is 0.53. The passive scalar is set to zero at y  0 within
the jet exit; if outside the jet exit at y  0 the gradient of the passive
scalar is set to zero. No-slip boundary conditions are applied at y  0
outside of the jet exit. A symmetry boundary condition is applied at
y  Lfreestream , a convective boundary condition at x  Ldown , and a
periodic boundary condition in the z-direction.
Three grids, with dimensions of 286  80  70, 574  161  142,
and 1150  323  286 are used. The grids are obtained by doubling
the number of points in each dimension of the next coarsest grid,
while keeping the grid stretching parameters the same. The time steps
used on the grids are 0.008, 0.004, and 0.002, respectively. This
results in maximum CFL numbers of 0:2 in the x-direction, 0:1 in
the y-direction, and 0:08 in the z-direction. The results shown in the
present work are obtained on the 1150  323  286 grid, with the
other grids being used to verify grid independence.

decided that it is better to use the available resolution in the region of
most interest (over the blade surface) where accurate data are needed
for use in improving turbulence models. The inclusion of the plenum
and delivery tube will undoubtedly result in changes, but these
changes are not expected to result in differences in the important
physics of the ﬂow. However, to model the effect of the delivery tube
and plenum as closely as possible, the boundary condition at the jet
exit is speciﬁed as the mean velocity obtained from a simulation that
includes a plenum and delivery tube. Thus a preliminary simulation
is done including the plenum and delivery tube with a jet inclination
angle of 35 deg from the crossﬂow. From this simulation a mean jet
exit velocity boundary condition is extracted and used in a second set
of simulations in which all grid points are in the jet-crossﬂow region.
All results presented in this work are computed from this second set
of simulations.
A schematic of the ﬂow domain along with boundary conditions
and dimensions is given in Fig. 1. The origin of the coordinate system

One-dimensional spatial energy spectrum in z-direction.

Energy Spectra

Figure 2 shows one-dimensional spatial energy spectrums in the zdirection of the x- and y-components of velocity. This spectra is
obtained by interpolating the velocity on the uneven spatial grid onto
an even grid which is deﬁned by the smallest grid spacing in the
uneven grid and then transforming into discrete wave number space.
Regions in which the slope of the spectra matches the 5=3 slope
predicted by the turbulence theory of Kolmogoroff [21] can be seen.
Close agreement can be seen between the results obtained on the
574  161  142 grid and on the 1150  323  286 grid. The good
agreement with the results from the coarser grids may be due to the
use of a monotonic convection scheme, which adds viscosity in
regions where the gradients are large to prevent overshoots and
undershoots. As a result, on an unresolved grid, the scheme behaves
as a LES model in which the model for the unresolved scales is the
added viscosity. This effect has been termed monotonic-integrated
large eddy simulation (MILES) by Oran and Boris [22].

B.

Convergence of Statistics

In the present work all statistics are computed as a running
average. The numerous terms that must be computed as a running
average to reconstitute the correlations appearing in the exact k and "
equations [Eqs. (7) and (9)] are given in Muldoon [18]. Statistics are
averaged over 567,822 time steps on the 1150  323  286 grid after
an initialization period of 64,000 time steps to allow the ﬂow to
become statistically fully developed and eliminate the effect of the
initial conditions. The sampling rate is one, i.e., the solution at every
time step is used in determining the statistics. With a time step of
0.002, this corresponds to the ﬂow traveling 1136d and 128d at U0 ,
respectively. These time-averaging periods are met or exceeded on
the coarser grids.
Figure 3 shows statistics on the three grids; the small difference
between the two ﬁnest grids is evidence of essentially grid
independent results. Note that for this geometry and boundary
conditions, in particular, the time invariance of the boundary
conditions, the Reynolds stress u0 w0 is theoretically zero at the jet
centerline (Muldoon [18]) and its value serves as an indicator of the
quality of the time-averaging period and sampling rate. As it is an
order of magnitude less than the other (nonzero) Reynolds stress
components this suggests that the time-averaging period and
sampling rate are sufﬁcient.
Because Eqs. (7) and (9) are not derived from discretized versions
of Eqs. (1) and (2), the residuals of Eqs. (7) and (9) are not expected to
be of the same order relative to the terms in Eqs. (7) and (9) as the
residuals of Eqs. (1) and (2) are relative to the terms in Eqs. (1) and
(2). However, the residuals of Eqs. (7) and (9) should decrease with
the order of spatial accuracy of the method used to compute them if

the time-averaged ﬂowﬁeld is examined, as discussed later (Fig. 7).
The CVP entrains ﬂuid from the crossﬂow into the jet, promoting
mixing of the jet with the crossﬂow. As a result of vortex induction,
the CVP causes the jet to lift away from the surface, which is
undesirable for ﬁlm cooling. The horseshoe vortex forms upstream
of the jet, wraps around the jet, and reorients itself in the streamwise
direction (Fig. 5). This vortex is actually a number of vortices (see
Fig. 7) and remains close to the blade surface. Its role is to entrain
coolant ﬂuid from the jet and thereby cool the blade surface along its
trajectory as seen in Fig. 5. Shear layer vortices form at the boundary
between the jet and the crossﬂow (Fig. 5). These vortices begin small
but grow into large scale structures by 3d–4d downstream of the jet
center. Behind the jet a region of low pressure and velocity is formed.
In this region a recirculation pattern emerges that entrains ﬂuid into
the jet. Wake vortices are not seen in this ﬂow, likely due to the low
blowing ratio and small jet inclination angle which result in a jet close
to the blade surface.

the temporal averaging period and sampling rate is sufﬁcient.
Assuming that the residual is dominated by the lowest order
truncation error terms, the order of convergence in the residual as the
grid spacing is reduced can be computed. Using the L1 norm of the
residual the order of convergence in the residual of Eq. (7) is found to
be 1.45 using the 286  80  70 and 574  161  142 grids and 2.43
using the 574  161  142 and 1150  323  286 grids. As the
overall order of convergence of the numerical method is given by the
lowest order schemes used, which is second-order for both the
continuity equation and the pressure gradient; this shows that this
order of convergence is maintained in computing the terms in the k
equation. Using this same norm, the order of convergence in the
residual of Eq. (9) is 0.38 and 0.17, respectively. It is known to be
difﬁcult to compute a balanced " equation [23]; this is likely due to
the large number of extremely complicated terms involving highorder correlations in this equation. Nevertheless, the residual,
whereas not decaying at the rate expected from the spatial accuracy
of the numerical scheme, is bounded by other terms in Eq. (7).
Figure 4 shows the residual to be bounded by 2u0i;k u0i;m u0k;m (one of
the terms comprising the production of ") and 2u0i;km u0i;km 1=Re
(one of the terms comprising the destruction of ").

First- and Second-Order Statistics

The mean scalar is shown in various planes in Fig. 6c. Note that the
maximum and minimum shown on ﬁgures in this work apply to the
surfaces shown in the ﬁgures and not the entire ﬁeld. The signature of
the horseshoe vortex on the blade surface shows up distinctly in this
ﬁgure. The horseshoe vortex entrains a small amount of ﬂuid from
the leading edge of the jet, and transports it downstream as the vortex
wraps around the jet and orients itself in the streamwise direction.
The effect of the horseshoe vortex in keeping the velocity magnitude
small near the blade surface is evident in Fig. 6b, which shows a
crossﬂow region between the horseshoe vortex and the CVP near the

Flow Physics

Jets in crossﬂow contain a number of distinct ﬂow structures [24].
These structures are a counterrotating vortex pair (CVP) of kidneyshaped vortices, a horseshoe vortex, shear layer vortices, and upright
wake vortices. As the jet is deﬂected by the crossﬂow it splits into the
CVP. Whereas it is difﬁcult to distinguish the CVP in an
instantaneous image of the ﬂowﬁeld (Fig. 5), it can be clearly seen if

blade surface in which the velocity magnitude is large. A stagnation
region in front of the jet, where the horseshoe vortex forms, and a
low-pressure region behind the jet can be seen in the mean pressure
ﬁeld in Fig. 6a. A region behind the jet at x 2d, in which the value
of the scalar on the blade surface is higher than further downstream,
can be seen in Fig. 6c. This likely is a result of the recirculation
pattern in this region in which crossﬂow ﬂuid is entrained into the jet
wake. The CVP and the horseshoe vortex can be seen in Fig. 7, in
which for clarity every eighth vector in each direction and half of the
domain in the (symmetric) z-direction is shown. The horseshoe
vortex consists of two vortices with opposite rotation, whereas the
CVP is seen to form two vortices with the same sense of rotation.
The normal Reynolds stresses are shown in Fig. 8. The u0 u0
component is larger than the other components and has its highest
values in the shear layer where large velocity gradients exist. The u0 u0
component also dominates the horseshoe vortex, growing
signiﬁcantly in strength as the horseshoe vortex convects in the
downstream direction. It starts to form a peak near the wall at
x 10d. The smallest component is v0 v0 , which spreads towards the
wall as the downstream distance increases. A spike in the w0 w0
component exists in the recirculation region behind the jet at x 2d
where the crossﬂow collides in the z-direction after wrapping around
the jet.
The shear stress components of the Reynolds stress tensor are
shown in Fig. 9. The strong anisotropy of the ﬂow ﬁeld can be seen in

this ﬁgure. In particular the v0 w0 component experiences a sign
change that occurs near the boundary between the jet and the
crossﬂow and appears clearly in the y–z plane at x 5d in Fig. 9c.
Figure 10 shows that the scalar ﬂuctuations are highest in the shear
layer and reach a maximum at x 5d. The scalar ﬂuctuations are
small in the horseshoe vortex. The turbulent kinetic energy has a
different behavior, reaching a maximum further downstream at
roughly x 7:5d and is signiﬁcant in the horseshoe vortex. It can be
seen that turbulent kinetic energy in the recirculation region is small
except for a peak at x 2d, which is due to the contribution of w0 w0 .
B.

Eddy Viscosity

Overprediction of the eddy viscosity by the model [C k2 ="Re]
can be seen quite clearly in Fig. 11c. The eddy viscosity obtained
from DNS [using Eq. (11)] is actually negative in certain regions,
which is not permitted by the model [C k2 ="Re], in which the eddy
viscosity is always positive. The eddy viscosity obtained from
Eq. (11) enables some modeled terms (as discussed later) to be
represented accurately, a factor which perhaps should be considered
in the design of turbulence models, which traditionally assume that
the eddy viscosity is positive. It can be clearly seen that the modeled
eddy viscosity overpredicts the values obtained from the DNS and
Eq. (11). Therefore calculations done with the traditional eddy
viscosity expression are likely to overpredict jet spreading and
turbulence levels. Using the wall normal turbulent ﬂuctuations in the
expression for the eddy viscosity [C 32 v0 v0 k="Re] can be seen
(Fig. 11b) to result in a better model for the eddy viscosity,

particularly near the wall where the overprediction of the eddy
viscosity is greatly reduced relative to the C k2 ="Re model.
C.

Exact k Equation

Figure 12 shows the various terms in the exact k equation, Eq. (7).
For this ﬂow it can be seen that all terms are signiﬁcant, with the
exception of molecular diffusion of k, which is only important in a
very small region very close to the wall. Dissipation appears to be less
signiﬁcant in the CVP, whereas production appears to be more
signiﬁcant there. The dissipation term approximates a negative
mirror of the production term in Figs. 12 and 13, with the exception of
the wall where the production is zero while dissipation is large. At the
wall dissipation is balanced by the diffusion terms @=@x2 
1=Re@k=@x2   12 u0i u0i u02  p0 u02 , which are the only nonzero
terms at the wall. Convective transport of k is signiﬁcant, particularly
in the CVP, unlike a developed channel ﬂow for which it is
theoretically zero. Figures 12e and 12f show the two parts of the
turbulent diffusion term, the sum of which are modeled as a diffusion
process. Very different distributions are seen between these two
terms, which suggests that modeling them as a single diffusion
process is inappropriate. This is also seen in Fig. 14 where these
terms are of comparable magnitude, whereas for a channel ﬂow the
term involving ﬂuctuations in pressure is much smaller. This
suggests that models that have been tuned and work well for a
channel ﬂow will experience difﬁculties for a ﬁlm cooling ﬂow. A
rapid change in @=@xj  12 u0i u0i u0j  (in which the sign changes) can
be seen at the top of the jet. This change in sign will be predicted by
the gradient of k (see Fig. 10b), which is used when this term, along
with @=@xj p0 u0j , is modeled as proportional to the diffusion of
k. However, this same change in sign does not occur in
@=@xj p0 u0j , which suggests again that this part of the term is not
modeled well by being made proportional to the diffusion of k.

As for the exact k equation, all terms are signiﬁcant with the
exception of molecular diffusion of ". Production and destruction are
approximately negative mirror images of each other near the wall,
but away from the wall destruction is positive within the jet.
Production is large near the wall, within the horseshoe vortices and
within the jet with the exception of a region within the jet where it is
small. Convective transport reaches a maximum in the horseshoe
vortex and a minimum near the wall in between the CVP and the
horseshoe vortex. It is a signiﬁcant term, unlike a channel ﬂow where
it is theoretically zero. Molecular diffusion of " is insigniﬁcant except
very close to the wall. Figures 15e and 15f show the two parts of the
turbulent diffusion term, the sum of which are modeled as a diffusion
process. Very different distributions are seen between these two

terms, suggesting that modeling them as a single diffusion process is
inappropriate. Both parts of the turbulent diffusion of " term are
shown in Fig. 16 along the streamwise midplane and three lateral
planes. The term involving pressure has extrema nearly two orders of
magnitude greater than the other term; however, these extrema are
concentrated near the front edge of the jet on the wall (discussed
later). In the rest of the ﬂow, the terms are similar in magnitude. This
is unlike a channel ﬂow for which the term involving ﬂuctuations in
pressure is much smaller. However, they have different distributions,
with the term @=@xj u0j u0i;m u0i;m  changing sign twice in the
vertical direction, whereas @=@xj 2p0;m u0j;m  changes sign once.
Note that this difference between the term involving pressure and the
term that does not is also seen in the exact k equation.
In Fig. 17a the destruction term is positive in a large region in the
jet away from the wall. The production term (see Fig. 17b) is large in
the recirculation region and is negative at the wall immediately
behind the jet. The extrema in production are concentrated near the
front edge of the jet on the wall and are discussed later.

Modeled k Equation

A comparison of the DNS computed production term
[u0i u0j @u i =@xj ] with two models, 2C k2 ="ReSi;j Si;j and
2Re1
 Si;j Si;j , is given in Fig. 18. Note that the only difference
between the two models in Fig. 18 is the eddy viscosity, which is
deﬁned to be C k2 ="Re (standard k–" model) or Re1
 [as obtained
from Eq. (11)]. As Eq. (11) ﬁnds an eddy viscosity such that it
minimizes the error in the approximation of the Reynolds stresses
using Eq. (6), it should provide a better approximation of the
production term than the standard k–" model, which uses

Fig. 18 Production term from exact k equation [Eq. (7)] vs models.

C k2 ="Re to represent the eddy viscosity. The only part of the
production term that is modeled is u0i u0j , and as this is modeled using
the Boussinesq gradient approximation, the use of the eddy viscosity
found from Eq. (6) results in the best possible model for u0i u0j when
using the Boussinesq gradient approximation. As the errors in the
modeled production term are strictly the result of errors in
representing the Reynolds stresses, this provides a good measure of
the ability of the minimization procedure [Eq. (11)] in combination
with the Boussinesq gradient approximation, to represent the
Reynolds stresses. It can be seen that using the eddy viscosity
computed from Eq. (11) results in almost identically the same value
as the DNS computed production term [u0i u0j @u i =@xj ]. In
contrast, using C k2 ="Re for the eddy viscosity results in an order
of magnitude overprediction of the production term, particularly near
the blade surface and in the jet region. Nevertheless, the qualitative
behavior of the production term is predicted reasonably well using
C k2 ="Re. Note that the eddy viscosity computed from Eq. (11)
(see Fig. 11) is negative in certain regions, which allows the modeled
term 2Re1
 Si;j Si;j to be negative in certain regions, as is the DNS
computed production term [u0i u0j @u i =@xj ].
The turbulent diffusion terms [@=@xj  12 u0i u0i u0j  p0 u0j ] in the
exact k equation are lumped together and modeled as a single
diffusion process in the standard k–" model. Figure 19 compares the
DNS computed value of turbulent diffusion [@=@xj 

 =k @k=@xj , the ﬁrst of which uses
C k2 ="Re, the second Re1
 [as obtained from Eq. (11)], as the
eddy viscosity. The model using an eddy viscosity of C k2 ="Re
undershoots the DNS computed value by an order of magnitude. If
2
Re1
 is used in place of C k ="Re, the result is much better. These
results demonstrate that the problem with the modeling of this term is
with the choice of the eddy viscosity expression. Therefore this term
can be modeled well as a diffusion process, if the eddy viscosity is
chosen appropriately. The residual (i.e., the imbalance) of all the
modeled terms in the modeled k equation (Fig. 20) illustrates the
large errors in the standard k–" model. These errors are particularly
large on the wall.

the ﬁrst uses C k2 ="Re whereas the second uses Re1

the large negative values of the production term, based on the

these large negative values only appear on the wall at certain
locations at the front edge of the jet, where the production term of the
exact " equation has large maxima and minima (see Fig. 22a). In the
jet region, it can be seen that the model using C k2 ="Re as the eddy

viscosity greatly overpredicts the production term. The model using
Re1
 [as obtained from Eq. (11)] results in values much closer to that
computed from the exact " equation, although it also overpredicts the
production in the jet region. Note that both of the models predict a
zero value for production on the wall, whereas there is no reason why
the actual term in the exact " equation will be zero (see Fig. 21a). For
the standard k–" model (2C"1 C kSi;j Si;j Re) this zero value on the
wall is a result of k being zero on the wall. For the model using Re1

for the eddy viscosity, it is more complicated due to the term
k1 Re1
 , which results in 0=0 on the wall. In the present work, this
has been deﬁned to be zero. The production term is modeled as a
positive term in the standard k–" model; however, on the wall in the
recirculation region behind the jet, it assumes large negative values.
Note that negative values are allowed in the model that uses Re1
 , as
Re1
 may be negative and indeed is so in part of the recirculation
region.
As the destruction term in the exact " equation is believed to be
primarily negative, the standard k–" model represents this term by an
expression [C"2 "2 =kRe] that is always less than or equal to zero.
Figure 23 shows that this term, as computed from the exact "
equation, has very large negative values next to and on the wall, but
that it is positive (although small) in the jet region away from the
wall. The model underpredicts the destruction term in the
recirculation region behind the jet. The destruction term, as
computed from both the exact " equation and the model, shows
signiﬁcant negative values within the horseshoe vortex at x 5d,
although only in the model does this persist downstream. Note that as
a result of division by k the model is ill-behaved in parts of the ﬂow,
such as the freestream where k approaches zero, near the wall where k
also approaches zero, and at the wall where k is zero.
Figure 24 compares the turbulent diffusion term of the exact "

difference between these two models is that, for the eddy viscosity,
the ﬁrst uses C k2 ="Re whereas the second uses Re1
 [as obtained
from Eq. (11)]. As is the case for the production term of the exact "
equation, the maximum and minimum values of the turbulent
diffusion term from the exact " equation occur on the wall at certain
locations at the front edge of the jet (see Fig. 22b). In the jet region,
the model using C k2 ="Re as the eddy viscosity greatly under- and
overpredicts turbulent diffusion, whereas the model using Re1
 is a
signiﬁcant improvement. This overprediction by the model using
C k2 ="Re is also seen in the horseshoe vortex system. However,

region.
G.

Damping Function

A serious problem with the standard k–" model is that it
overpredicts the eddy viscosity (see Fig. 11). This error can be
reduced by the use of what is termed a damping function, designed to
reduce or damp the eddy viscosity. The damping function (fdns ) used
in the present work is intended for use as in Eq. (12).

From the DNS data fdns is deﬁned at every discrete point in the
spatial domain. For practical use, however, it must be a simple
expression of variables available in turbulence models. There are
various damping functions in the literature [17]; generally, if
designed using DNS data, they have been obtained from simple ﬂows
such as ﬂow in a channel or a boundary layer in which two directions
are homogeneous. The damping function is commonly
made a
p
function of a nondimensional distance [y  y =@u=@y]
from the wall. The damping function proposed by Rodi and Mansour
[17] was obtained by ﬁtting a function dependent on y to DNS data
for a channel ﬂow. However, the use of this nondimensional distance
to construct a damping function for a highly three-dimensional ﬂow,
with no homogeneous directions, is problematic. Figure 25 shows
that plotting fdns vs y does not collapse well, whereas it does so if
plotted against y. The reason for this is that, unlike in a channel ﬂow,
the wall shear is not a constant but instead varies across the wall in
both directions; indeed there are places, such as in the recirculation

v0 v0 =k. The behavior of the damping function is that it increases
approximately linearly in y in the wall normal direction from zero at
the wall to 12 in the freestream. Plotting the damping function vs
v0 v0 =k shows a linear relationship in a certain region. However, the
damping function is not a unique one to one function of v0 v0 =k, so
starting from zero at the wall or zero in the freestream there are two
possible directions to take. The ﬁrst, which quickly leads to a peak in
the damping function, is the same peak that occurs in the freestream;
therefore, this branch is the one starting in the freestream. The second
(which increases approximately linearly from zero and asymptotes to
1
) is the one starting at the wall and shown in Fig. 26. From this
2
behavior a simple equation can be written which approximates the
dependence of the damping function on the wall normal turbulent
ﬂuctuations [Eq. (14)].

The purpose of this equation is to damp the eddy viscosity near the
wall using the wall normal turbulent ﬂuctuations (which are very
sensitive to the presence of a wall) as a measure of the distance from
the wall. This idea is not new; the v2 f–k" model of Durbin [25,26] is
based on this observation. Figure 27 shows the improvement
obtained from the new damping function as the overprediction of the
eddy viscosity is greatly reduced whereas the correct qualitative
behavior of the eddy viscosity is maintained.
Whereas the wall normal turbulent ﬂuctuations correlate well with
the damping function, they are not available in a two-equation
turbulent model such as the k–" model. Therefore Eq. (14) cannot be
used with such turbulence models. A damping function for twoequation turbulent models
p must be based on the variables available in
such models. If = k is used as a characteristic length (based on
the equilibrium assumption), a different nondimensional distance
(y
k ) from the wall can be deﬁned which correlates well with the

Conclusions

Using direct numerical simulation, all terms in the exact k and "
equations have been computed and compared with the standard k–"
model for a ﬁlm cooling jet ﬂow. The effect of the grid spacing on the
results using three different grids has been studied and along with the
spatial energy spectrum shows that the important turbulent scales
have been resolved. The residuals of the exact k and " equations
decrease as the grid spacing decreases, indicating that the terms in
these equations have been properly computed.

Unlike a channel ﬂow, the terms in the exact k and " equations that
contain correlations involving pressure have been shown to be
signiﬁcant for a ﬁlm cooling jet. In addition, the correlations
involving pressure have been shown to behave differently than the
correlations involving just the velocity, contrary to what is typically
assumed. This is of interest as turbulence models commonly model
these two terms as a single diffusion process.
The eddy viscosity concept has been tested extensively by
comparing the terms in the exact k and " equations computed from
DNS to the standard k and " models for the terms and also to the same
standard k and " models using an eddy viscosity obtained from DNS.
The greatest weakness in the standard k–" model has been shown to
be the choice of the eddy viscosity. If the eddy viscosity is chosen by
a method that applies a minimization procedure to the DNS data, the
various models for the terms in the exact k and " equations represent
the terms relatively well. Therefore the challenge is to improve the
model for the eddy viscosity. A step is made in this direction by two
proposed new damping functions. The ﬁrst damping function is
based on the wall normal turbulent ﬂuctuations and is shown to
greatly reduce the overprediction of the eddy viscosity in the
standard k–" model. However, this damping function based on the
wall normal turbulent ﬂuctuations cannot be used with two-equation
turbulence models such as the standard k–" model. To alleviate this
problem, a second new damping function is proposed which can be
used by two-equation turbulence models. This damping function is
based on a nondimensional distance from the wall and is shown to
greatly improve the computation of the eddy viscosity in the standard
k–" model.
